Zarathustra Vs. Rheims
</h2>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">George Soule</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">H</span><span class="postfirstchar">auptmann</span> and Rolland have quarreled about the war, Hæckel has
repudiated his English honorary degrees, and now Thomas Hardy has
placed on Nietzsche the responsibility for the destruction of the cathedral
of Rheims. The tragedy of nationalism, it seems, is not content with ruining
lives and art; it must also vitiate philosophy and culture.
</p>

<p>
“Nietzsche and his followers, Treitschke, Von Bernhardi, and others,”
writes Hardy. In the next sentence he speaks of “off-hand assumptions.”
One is tempted to write, “Christ and his followers, Czar Nicholas, Kaiser
Wilhelm, and others!”
</p>

<p>
Nietzsche has been claimed as a prophet by hereditary aristocrats, by
anarchists, by socialists, by artists, and by militarists. There is even a book
to prove that he who called himself “the Antichrist” was a supporter of
the Catholic Church. One suspects, however, that the Jesuit who wrote it
had a subtle sense of truth.
</p>

<p>
The most fundamental truth about Nietzsche is that the torrent of his
inspiration is open to everyone who can drink of it. His value, his quality,
consist not in the fact that he said this or that, but that life in him was
strong and beautiful. This is true of all prophets; how much more so, then,
of the one who threw to the winds all stiffness of orthodoxy and insisted
on a transvaluation of all values! “O my soul, to thy domain gave I all
wisdom to drink, all new wines, and also all immemorially old strong wines
of wisdom,” said Zarathustra.
</p>

<p>
But even in his teachings we can find no justification of the present
shame of Europe. It was Darwin who laid the foundation for the philosophy
of the survival of the fittest and the struggle for existence. With the shallow
inferences from these conceptions Nietzsche had no patience. If the
fittest survives, the fittest is not necessarily the best. The brute force which
makes for survival had no attraction for Nietzsche. He called upon man’s
will to make itself the deciding factor in the struggle. When he argued for
strength, he argued for the strength of the beautiful and noble, not strength
for its own sake. Of what avail is a great individual to the world if he
makes himself weak and sacrifices himself to an inferior enemy? The
French gunners who defended the Cathedral of Rheims might justly claim
the approval of Nietzsche. If the Allies had turned the other cheek and
allowed their countries to be overrun by German militarism, they would
then have proved themselves Christian and truly anti-Nietzschean.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Nietzsche uncompromisingly opposed the supremacy of mere
numbers, the supremacy of non-spiritual values. He argued after the war
of 1870 that the victory of Prussian arms endangered rather than helped
Prussian culture. Culture is a thing of the spirit; it was undermined by the
tide of smug satisfaction in the triumph of militarism.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
“You say that a good cause will even justify war; I tell you that it is
the good war that justifies all causes,” wrote Nietzsche. It is the logic of
the newspaper paragrapher which makes this statement a justification of militarism.
<em>The good war</em>—what is that? It is the quality of heroism, the unreckoning
love of beauty, the pride of the soul in its own strength and purity.
It is the opponent of mere contentment and sluggishness. It is the militant
virtue which has inspired great souls since the beginning of the world; it is
the hope of future man. If a cause is not justified by the good war what
can be said for it? It is a pathetic absurdity to think that Nietzsche would
have found the good war in the present struggle for territory and commercial
supremacy. No, gentlemen of letters, fight the Kaiser if you must, but
do not aim your clods at the prophets in your hasty partisanship!
</p>

<p>
For it is in this very Nietzsche and his good war that mankind will now
find its spirit of hope. We who see that wars of gunpowder are evil, we
who intend to abolish them, cannot do so by denying our own strength and
appealing helplessly to some external power in the sky. We must say with
Zarathustra,
</p>

<p>
“How could I endure to be a man, if man were not also the composer,
the riddle-reader, and the redeemer of chance!
</p>

<p>
“To redeem what is past, and to transform every ‘It was’ into ‘Thus
would I have it!’ that only do I call redemption!
</p>

<p>
“Will—so is the emancipator and joy-bringer called: thus have I taught
you, my friends!”
</p>

<div class="filler">
<p class="noindent">
In <em>Ecce Homo</em> the word “German” has become something like his worst term of
abuse. He believes only in French culture; all other culture is a misunderstanding.
In his deepest instincts Nietzsche asserts to be so foreign to everything German,
that the mere presence of a German “retards his digestion.” German intellect is to
him indigestion. If he has been so enthusiastic in his devotion to Wagner, this was
because in Wagner he honored the foreigner, because in him he saw the incarnate
protest against all German virtues, the “counter-poison” (he believed in Wagner’s
Jewish descent). He allows the Germans no honor as philosophers: Leibnitz and
Kant were “the two greatest clogs upon the intellectual integrity of Europe.” No
less passionately does he deny to the Germans all honor as musicians: “A German
<em>cannot</em> know what music is. The men who pass as German musicians are foreigners,
Slavs, Croats, Italians, Dutchmen, or Jews.” He abhors the “licentiousness” of the
Germans in historical matters: “History is actually written on Imperial German
and Antisemitic lines, and Mr. Treitschke is not ashamed of himself.” The Germans
have on their conscience every crime against culture committed in the last four centuries
(they deprived the Renaissance of its meaning; they wrecked it by the Reformation).
When, upon the bridge of two centuries of decadence, a <em>force majeure</em>
of genius and will revealed itself, strong enough to weld Europe into political and
economic unity, the Germans finally with their “Wars of Liberation,” robbed Europe
of the meaning of Napoleon’s existence, a prodigy of meaning. Thus they have
upon their conscience all that followed, nationalism, the <em>névrose nationale</em> from which
Europe is suffering, and the perpetuation of the system of little states, of petty
politics.—<em>George Brandes in “Friedrich Nietzsche.”</em>

The Cost of War

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Clarence Darrow</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">long</span> with the many other regrets over the ravages of war is the
sorrow for the destruction of property. As usual, those who have nothing
to lose join in the general lamentation. There is enough to mourn
about in the great European Holocaust without conjuring up imaginary
woes. So far as the vast majority of people is concerned, the destruction
of property is not an evil but a good.
</p>

<p>
The lands and houses, the goods and merchandise and money of
the world are owned by a very few. All the rest in some way serve that
few for so much as the law of life and trade permit them to exact. At
the best, this is but a small share of the whole. All the property destroyed
by war belongs to the owners of the earth; it is for them that
wars are fought, and it is they who pay the bills. When the war is
over, the property must be re-created. This, the working men will do.
In this re-building, they will work for wages. Then, as now, the rate
of wages will be fixed by the law of demand and supply—the demand and
supply of those who toil. The war will create more work and less workmen.
Therefore labor can and will get a greater share of its production
than it could command if there was less work and more workmen.
The wages must be paid from the land and money and other property
left when the war is done. This will still be in the hands of the few,
and these few will be compelled to give up a greater share. The destruction
of property, together with its re-creation means only a re-distribution
of wealth—a re-distribution in which the poor get a greater share.
It is one way to bring about something like equality of property—a cruel,
wasteful, and imperfect way, but still a way. That the equality will
not last does not matter, for in the period of re-construction the workman
will get a larger share and will live a larger life.
</p>

<p>
As the war goes on, the funds for paying bills will be met in the old
way by selling bonds. These too will be paid by the owners of the earth.
True, the property from which the payment comes must be produced
by toil, but if the bonds that must be paid from the fruits of labor had
never been issued this surplus would not have gone to labor, but would
have been absorbed by capital. This is true for the simple reason that
the return to labor is not fixed by the amount of production, the rate of
taxation, the price of interest and rents, but by the supply and demand of
labor, and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
If labor shall sometime be wise enough, or rather instinctive enough
to claim all that it produces, it will at the same time have the instinct
or wisdom to leave the rulers’ bonds unpaid.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
But all of this is far, far away; in determining immediate effects
we must consider what is, not what should be. And the jobless and
propertyless can only look upon the destruction of property as giving
them more work and a larger share of the product of their labor. Chicago
was never so prosperous, or wages so high, as when her people
were re-building it from the ashes of a general conflagration. San Francisco
found the same distribution of property amongst its workmen
after the earthquake and the fire had laid it waste, and her people were
called upon to build it up anew.
</p>

<p>
Carlyle records that during the long days of destruction in the
French Revolution the people were more prosperous and happy than they
had ever been before. True, the Guilotin was doing its deadly work
day after day, but its victims were very few. The people got used to
the guilotin, and heeded it no more than does the crowd heed a hanging
in our county jail, when they gayly pass in their machines.
</p>

<p>
After the first shock was over, during the four years of our Civil
War, wages were higher, men were better employed, production greater,
and distribution more equal than it had been at any time excepting in the
extreme youth of the Republic. Then land was free.
</p>

<p>
Then again, this world has little to destroy. After centuries of so-called
civilization, the human race has not accumulated enough to last
a year should all stop work. The world lives, and always has lived, from
hand to mouth. This is not because of any trouble in producing wealth,
but because things are made not to use, but to sell. And the wages of
the great mass of men does not permit them to buy or own more than
they consume from day to day.
</p>

<p>
It is for this reason that half the people do not really work; that
the market for labor is fitful and uncertain, and never great enough;
and that all are poor. After a devastation like a great war, the need of
re-creating will turn the idle and the shirkers into workmen, because the
rewards will be greater. This will easily and rapidly produce more than
ever before. From this activity, invention will contrive new machines to
compete with men, going once more around the same old circle, until
the world finds out that machines should be used to satisfy human wants
and not to build up profits for the favored few.
</p>

<p>
One may often regret the impulses that bring destruction of property,
but before any one mourns over the destruction of property, purely
because of its destruction, he should ask whose property it is.

ones that’s got to face it. We’re the ones that’s got to stand all the scandal
and talk there’ll be about it. Just think what the family’ll say. Think what
the neighbors’ll say. I don’t know what we done to have such a thing happen
to us. (<em>Mrs. Ransome breaks into a spell of exaggerated weeping, which
ceases as the door-bell rings.</em>) There! That’s the minister. God only
knows what I’d better say to him. (<em>Mrs. Ransome hurriedly attempts to tidy
the room, knocking over a chair in her haste, pulls up the blinds half-way and
returns to her chair. There is a knock at the door. Mrs. Ransome breaks
into a prolonged howl.</em>) Come in.
</p>

<p>
(<em>Enter Rev. Mr. Tanner. He is a stout, pompous clergyman, with a rich,
middle-class congregation and a few poorer members, amongst which latter
he numbers the Ransomes. His general attitude is kind but patronizing; he
displays none of the effusive desire to please which is his correct demeanor
towards his richer congregants. The elder Ransomes regard him as their
spiritual leader, and worship him along with God at a respectful distance.</em>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner</span> (<em>He speaks in a hushed voice, glancing towards the kneeling
figure of Janet</em>). Bear up, Mrs. Ransome. Bear up, I beg of you! (<em>Mrs.
Ransome howls more vigorously; Tanner is embarrassed.</em>) This is very distressing,
Mrs. Ransome.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome</span> (<em>Between her sobs</em>). It certainly is kind of you to come,
Mr. Tanner, I’m sure. We didn’t expect to see you when my husband ’phoned
you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Where is your husband now?
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> He’s gone to send some telegrams to Bob’s family, sir—<em>his</em>
family. We’d planned to have a quiet wedding, sir, with only me and
her father and aunt, and then we was goin’ to have the rest of the family in,
this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> It’s a very sad thing, Mrs. Ransome.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> It’s fairly dazed us, Mr. Tanner. Comin’ on top of all
the preparation we’ve bin makin’ for the past two weeks, too. An’ her father’s
spent a pile o’ money on their new furniture an’ things.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner</span> (<em>Speaking in an undertone</em>). Was he insured?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> No, sir, not a penny. That’s why it comes so hard on
us just now, havin’ the expense of a funeral on top of what we’ve just spent
for the weddin’.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Well, Mrs. Ransome, I’ll try to help you in any way I can.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Thank you, Mr. Tanner. It certainly is fine of you to
say so. Everybody’s bin good to us, sir. She had all them presents given
her—most of them was from <em>my</em> side of the family.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Did he have any relatives here?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Not a soul, poor fellow. He came from up-state.
That’s why my husband’s gone to send a telegram askin’ his father to come
to the funeral.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> How long will your husband be? (<em>He glanced at his watch.</em>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> I don’t think he’ll be more than half an hour. He’d like
to see you, if you could wait that long, I know.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Very well. I have an engagement later, but I can let that go
if necessary.
</p>

<p>
(<em>Tanner and Mrs. Ransome sit down in front of the table.</em>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> It certainly is a great comfort havin’ you here, Mr.
Tanner. I feel so upset I don’t know what to say.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Bear up, Mrs. Ransome. You are not the greatest sufferer.
Let me say a few words to your daughter. (<em>He rises, goes to Janet, and
places his hand on her shoulder, but she takes no notice of him.</em>) Miss Ransome,
you must try to bear up, too. I know how hard it is, but you must
remember it’s something that must come to all of us.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> She takes it so bad, Mr. Tanner, that the Lord should
have took him on their weddin’ mornin’.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner</span> (<em>Returning to his chair</em>). We must not question, Mrs. Ransome,
we must not question. The Almighty has thought fit to gather him
back to the fold, and we must submit to His will. In such moments as these
we feel helpless. We feel the need of a Higher Being to cling to—to find
consolation. Time is the great healer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> But to expect a weddin’ (<em>Sobs</em>) and find it’s a funeral—it’s
awful; (<em>Sobs</em>) and besides—Mr. Tanner, you’ve always been good to us.
We’re in other trouble, too. Worse—worse even than this.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> In other trouble?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Yes, much worse. I just can’t bear to think about it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Your husband’s business?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> No, sir. It’s—I don’t know how to say it. It’s her
and him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Her and him?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Yes, sir—I’m almost ashamed to tell you. She’s goin’
to have a baby.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner</span> (<em>Astounded</em>). She’s going to be a mother?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Yes. (<em>Sobs.</em>) Oh, you don’t know how hard this is on
us, Mr. Tanner. We’ve always bin respectable people, sir, as you well know.
We’ve bin livin’ right here on this block these last ten years, an’ everybody
knows us in the neighborhood. Her father don’t know about it yet. What
he’ll say—God only knows.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> I’m terribly sorry to hear this, Mrs. Ransome.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> I can forgive her, sir, but not him. They say we
shouldn’t speak ill of the dead—but I always was opposed to her marryin’
him. I wanted her to marry a steady young fellow of her own religion, but
I might as well have talked to the wall, for all the notice she took of me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> It’s what we have to expect of the younger generation, Mrs.
Ransome. Let me see—how long were they engaged?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Well, sir, I suppose on and off it’s bin about three years.
He never could hold a job long, an’ me and her father said he couldn’t marry
her—not with our consent—until he was earnin’ at least twenty dollars a
week—an’ that was only right, considerin’ he’d have to support her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> I quite agree with you. I’m sorry to see a thing of this sort
happen—and right in my own congregation, too. I’ve expressed my views
from the pulpit from time to time very strongly upon the subject, but nevertheless
it doesn’t seem to make much difference in this neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> I know it’s a bad neighborhood in some ways, sir. But
you got to remember they was going to get married, sir. If you’d bin here only
an hour earlier, Mr. Tanner, there wouldn’t have bin no disgrace. (<em>Points
to official-looking book lying on table.</em>) Why, sir—there’s the marriage register—Mr.
Smith brought it down from church this morning—all waiting
for you to fix it. If you’d only come earlier, sir, they’d have bin properly
married, an’ there wouldn’t have bin a word said.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> That’s true. They might have avoided the immediate disgrace,
perhaps. But you know as well as I do that <em>that</em> isn’t the way to get
married. It isn’t so much a matter of disgrace. That means nothing. It’s
the principle of the thing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome</span> (<em>Eagerly</em>). Oh, Mr. Tanner, do you mean it? Do you
mean that the disgrace of it means nothin’?
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Well—not exactly nothing—but nothing to the principle of the
thing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> An’ would you save her from the disgrace of it, if you
could, Mr. Tanner, if it don’t mean nothin’?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> I’ll do anything I can to help you, within reason, Mrs. Ransome,
but how can I save her?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome</span> (<em>Eagerly pleading</em>). Mr. Tanner, if she has a child, as
she expects, you know that respectable people won’t look at us any more.
We’ll have to move away from here. We’ll be the laughing stock of the place.
It’ll break her father’s heart, as sure as can be. But if you could fill in the
marriage register as though they’d bin married, Mr. Tanner, why, nobody’s
to know that it isn’t all respectable and proper. They had their license, and
ring, and everything else, sir, as you know.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner</span> (<em>Astounded</em>). <em>Me</em> fill in the marriage register? Do you mean
that you want <em>me</em> to make a fictitious entry in the marriage register?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> It wouldn’t be so very fictitious, Mr. Tanner. They’d
have bin married regular if you’d only come half an hour earlier. Couldn’t
you fill it in that they was married before he died, sir?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> But that would be forgery.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> It would be a good action, Mr. Tanner—indeed, it
would. Her father an’ me haven’t done nothing to deserve it, but we’ll be
blamed for it just the same. It wouldn’t take you a minute to write it in the
register, Mr. Tanner. Look at all the years we’ve bin goin’ to your church,
and never asked you a favor before.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> My good woman, I’m sorry; I’d like to help you, but I don’t
see how I can. In the first place, don’t you see that you’re asking me to
commit forgery? But what’s more important, you’re asking me to act against
my own principles. I’ve been preaching sermons for years, and making a
public stand too, against these hasty marriages that break up homes and lead
to the divorce court—or worse. The church is trying to make marriage a
thing sacred and apart, instead of the mockery it is in this country today.
I sympathize with you. I know how hard it is. But for all I know, you
may be asking me to help you thwart the will of God.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> The will of God?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Mind you, I don’t say that it is, Mrs. Ransome, but it may
very well be the Hand of the Almighty. Your daughter and her young man,
as she has confessed herself, have tried to use the marriage ceremony—a <em>holy</em>
ceremony, mind you—to cover up what they’ve done.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Oh, don’t talk like that before her, Mr. Tanner.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. I’m sorry I
can’t help you. It wouldn’t be <em>right</em>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> But they was goin’ to get married, sir. You got to take
that into consideration. My girl ain’t naturally bad. It isn’t as though she’d
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
pick up any feller that happened to come along. Hundreds and thousands
do it, sir, indeed they do, and most of them much worse than she and him,
poor fellow.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Yes, there you are right. Thousands <em>do</em> do it, and I’ve been
making a stand against it in this neighborhood for years. I may seem hard,
Mrs. Ransome, but I’m trying my best to be fair. I sincerely believe that
no minister of the Gospel should ever legalize or condone—er—misconduct—that
is, before marriage.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome</span> (<em>Pleading hard</em>). You can’t know what this means to
us, sir—or you’d pity us, indeed you would. Her father’ll take on somethin’
dreadful when he hears about it. He’ll turn her out of the house, sir, as sure
as can be. You know him, sir. You know he’s too good a Christian to let
her stay here after she’s disgraced us all. And then, what’s to become of
her? She’ll lose her job, and who’ll give her another—without a reference—an’
a baby to support? That’s how they get started on the streets, sir (<em>Sobs</em>),
an’ you know it as well as I do.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Yes, I know. I wish I could help you. It’s very distressing—but
we all have to do our duty as we see it. But I do pity you, indeed I do.
From the bottom of my heart. I’ll do anything I can for you—within
reason.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome</span> (<em>Almost hysterical, dragging Janet from the side of the
body</em>). Janet, Janet! Ask him yourself. Ask him on your bended knees.
Ask him to save us! (<em>Janet attempts to return to side of the body.</em>) Janet,
do you want to ruin us? Can’t you speak to him? Can’t you ask him?
(<em>Mrs. Ransome breaks into sobs.</em>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> It is as I feared, Mrs. Ransome. Her heart is hardened.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> (<em>Rises and turns fiercely on him</em>). Whose heart’s hardened?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Come, come. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. I can’t
tell you how sorry I am for you, and your parents, too.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> Well, I’ll tell you flat, I don’t want none of your pity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Janet, don’t speak like that to him. You’re excited.
(<em>To Tanner</em>). She don’t mean it, sir—she’s all worked up.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> (<em>Her excitement increasing, and speaking in loud tones</em>). All
right, mother—I’ll tell him again—I don’t want none of his pity. I c’n get
along without it. An’ if you and him think that writin’ a few words in his
marriage register—or whatever he calls it—is going to make any difference,
well—you’re welcome to.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> My dear girl. Don’t you understand, if it was merely a
question of writing a few words, I’d do it in a minute. But it’s the principle
of the thing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> (<em>Bitingly</em>). Huh! Principle of the thing! I heard it all. You
preached against it, didn’t yer? It’s a pity you never preached a sermon on
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
how me and him could have gotten married two years ago, instead of waiting
till now, when it’s too late.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Others have to wait.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> We did wait. Isn’t three years long enough? D’ye think we
was made of stone? How much longer d’ye think we could wait? We
waited until we couldn’t hold out no longer. I only wish to God we hadn’t
waited at all, instead of wastin’ all them years.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome</span> (<em>Shocked</em>). Janet, you don’t know what you’re sayin’.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> I do, an’ I mean it. We waited, an’ waited, an’ waited. Didn’t
he try all he could to get a better job? ’Twasn’t his fault he couldn’t. We
was planning to go West, or somewhere—where he’d have more of a chance—we
was savin’ up for it on the quiet. An’ while we was waiting, we wanted
one another—all day an’ all night. An’ what use was it? We held out till
we couldn’t hold out no longer—an’ when we knew what was goin’ to happen,
well—we had to get married—an’ that all there’s to it!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner</span> (<em>Making a remarkable discovery, supporting all his personal
theories on the subject</em>). Ah! Then your idea was to marry <em>simply</em> because
you were going to have a baby!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> Of course it was. D’ye think we wanted to marry an’ live here
on the fifteen a week he was getting? We’d have bin starvin’ in a month.
But when this happened—we had to get married—starve or not. What else
could we do?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Well, I don’t know what to say. It seems to me that you
should have thought of all this before. You knew what it would mean to
have a baby.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> D’ye think I wanted a baby? I didn’t want one. I didn’t know
how to stop it. If you don’t like it—it’s a pity you don’t preach sermons on
how to stop havin’ babies when they’re not wanted. There’d be some sense
in that. That’d be more sense than talkin’ about waitin’—an’ waitin’—an’
waitin’. There’s hundreds of women round here—starvin’ and sufferin’—an’
havin’ one baby after another, and don’t know the first thing about how
to stop it. ’Tisn’t my fault I’m going to have one. I didn’t want it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Miss Ransome, your views simply astound me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> I can’t help it. People may think it wrong, an’ all that, but it
ain’t his fault and it ain’t mine. Don’t you think we used to get sick of goin’
to movies, an’ vaudeville shows, an’ all them other places—time after time?
I wanted him to love me, an’ I ain’t ashamed of it, neither.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Janet, how dare you talk like that in front of Mr.
Tanner? (<em>To Tanner.</em>) She don’t mean it, Mr. Tanner. She don’t know
what she’s saying. I’ve always brought her up to be innercent about things.
She must have got all this from the other girls at the store where she works.
She didn’t get it in her home, that’s sure.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> No, that I didn’t. Nor nothing else, neither. You was always
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
ashamed to tell me about anything, so I found out about things from other
girls, like the rest of ’em do. I’ve known it for years and years, an’ all the
while I suppose you’ve bin thinkin’ I didn’t know anything, I’ve known everything—all
except what’d be useful to me. If I’m going to have a baby it’s
your fault, mother, as much as anybody. You only had one yourself—but
you never told <em>me</em> nothin’.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Janet!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Miss Ransome, this is not a subject I ordinarily discuss, but
since you know what you do know, let me tell you that there is nothing
worse than trying to interfere with the workings of nature, or—if I may say
so—of God.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> Well, Bob said the rich people do it. He said they must know
how to do it, because they never have more’n two or three children in
a family; but you’ve only got to walk on the next block—where it’s all tenements—to
see ten and twelve in every family, because the workin’ people
don’t know any better. But I don’t want no pity from anybody. I can take
a chance on it. I got a pair of hands, an’ I c’n take care of myself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Mrs. Ransome, it’s no good my talking to your daughter while
she’s in this frame of mind. She appears to have most extraordinary views.
Mind you, I don’t blame you for it. She <em>seems</em> to be an intelligent girl.
There’d be some hope for her if she’d show a little penitence—a little regret
for what’s been done and can’t be undone. You know I don’t like preaching
out of church, but you’ve often heard me say in the pulpit that God is
always willing to forgive the humble and the penitent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> (<em>With fine scorn</em>). “God” indeed. Don’t make me laugh.
(<em>Points to body of Bob.</em>) Look at him lyin’ there. God? What’s God got
to do with it? (<em>She kneels again at the side of the couch, rigid and silent.
After an uncomfortable interval, Tanner rises.</em>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Well, I’m afraid I must be going. I feel very pained by what
your daughter has said, Mrs. Ransome. You know I have a deep regard for
you and your husband. I’m frank to say that if your daughter had shown
some signs of penitence—some remorse for what has happened—I might even
have gone so far as to have made the entry in the register—seeing the punishment
she’s already had. But as she is now, I don’t see what good it
would do. Really I don’t, so I think I’d better go.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome</span> (<em>Appealingly</em>). Oh, don’t go, Mr. Tanner. Wait just
a minute while I talk to her, please. Janet, can’t you say you’re sorry for
what you done? Can’t you see that Mr. Tanner only wants to be fair with
you? Come, do it for our sakes—your father and me. You know how hard
he’s worked, how he’s keep teetotal an’ everything. You don’t want to ruin
us, do you? Can’t you see it isn’t only yourself that’s got to be considered?
Think of what we’ve done for you. Tell him you’re sorry for it, <em>do</em>!
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner</span> (<em>Rising</em>). It’s no use, Mrs. Ransome. I can see it’s of no use.
I really must go.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Just one minute more. Please wait one minute more.
Janet, what’s the matter with you? Can’t you see the disgrace it’ll be to all
of us? Can’t you see it will ruin us to our dying days? They’ll all laugh at
us—an’ jeer at us. It’ll follow us around wherever we go. You know how
the folk round here make fun of your father—because he keeps himself
respectable—an’ saves his money. Do you want them to laugh at him? Do
you want them to be laughin’ at you an’ talkin’ about you? Do you want
them to be making fun of your baby—an’ calling it a bastard—an’ asking
who it’s father was?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> (<em>Nervously</em>). They wouldn’t.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Yes, they would. An’ all the time he’s growin’ up, the
other children in school’ll be tormentin’ him, and callin’ him names. Didn’t
the same thing happen with Susan Bradley’s boy? Didn’t they have to go
an’ live out in Jersey, cos she couldn’t stand it no longer? You know it as
well as I do.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> (<em>Defiantly</em>). They went away ’cos he was always gettin’ sick.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Of course he was always gettin’ sick—with all them
devils makin’ fun of him—an’ makin’ his life a misery. Didn’t we used to
see him goin’ down the block—with the tears runnin’ down his cheeks—an’
all of ’em yellin’ names after him. Just think of the baby you’re goin’ to
have. D’ye want that to happen to <em>your</em> baby? D’ye want them to make <em>its</em>
life a misery—same as the other one?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> (<em>Lifelessly</em>). They wouldn’t.

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Of course they would. They’ll tease an’ torment it,
just like the other—an’ when he’s old enough to understand—who’ll he blame
for it? He’ll blame <em>you</em> for it. (<em>Inspired</em>) He’ll blame Bob for it—he’ll hate
him for it. D’ye want your boy—Bob’s boy—to be hatin’ his own father?
What’d Bob say? What’d <em>he</em> think of you—ruinin’ his baby’s life—an’ all
just because you’re obstinate an’ won’t listen to reason. Can’t you see it?
Just think—if you’d only say you was in the wrong—an’ do what Mr. Tanner
asks you—he’d forgive you an’ make everything all right. Oh, Janet—can’t
you see it? Ask him—beg him!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> Oh, dear. Well—how c’n Mr. Tanner make it all right?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> You know what I mean. Oh, Janet, it won’t take him
a minute to write it. If he don’t, can’t you see it’ll ruin us all our lives?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> Only a minute to write it—or it’ll ruin us all our lives.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Oh, Janet, this is your last chance. Tell him you’re
sorry. (<em>To Tanner, who has edged towards the door, and is about to leave.</em>)
Oh, Mr. Tanner, please don’t go. Just wait another minute.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Really, I must go.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Oh, sir! I can see she’s sorry. You won’t go back on
your word, sir?
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet</span> (<em>Unwillingly feigning remorse</em>). Let me think a bit. Oh, Mr.
Tanner, I suppose I’m in the wrong—if you say so. It didn’t seem to me
to be wrong—that’s all I got to say. I hope you’ll forgive me. I’m sorry for
the way I spoke—and what I done.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner</span> (<em>Returning</em>). My child, it’s not for me to forgive you. I
knew I could appeal to something higher in you, if you’d only listen to me.
Are you truly repentant—from the bottom of your heart?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> As I said to your mother just now, I don’t like preaching
sermons, but I hope this has taught you that there can be no justification for
our moments of passion and wilfulness. We must all try to humble our
pride and our spirit. I won’t go back on my word, but when you start out
afresh you must try to wipe out the past by living for the future.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Janet.</span> I’ll try to, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> And now, Mrs. Ransome, I suppose I’ll have to make the
entry as though it had happened an hour or so ago. I know I may seem
soft-hearted about it. But I feel I am doing my duty. This may save your
daughter from a life of degradation. I think the end justifies the means.
But first, let me ask you, who knows that the ceremony wasn’t performed
before he died?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Only me—an’ her father—an’ my sister outside.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Can she be relied upon to hold her tongue?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> She surely can, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Well, you understand this is a very serious thing for me to
do. If it becomes public I shall be faced with a very unpleasant situation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome.</span> Oh, I promise you, Mr. Tanner, not a soul will know
of it. We’ll take our dyin’ oaths, sir, all of us.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> All right. But first let me lend your daughter this prayer-book.
(<em>Takes prayer-book out of pocket; addressing Janet.</em>) Here’s a
prayer-book, Miss Ransome. I’ll go with your mother now into the back-parlor,
and meanwhile I want you to read over this prayer. Try to seek its
inner meeting. Come, Mrs. Ransome, you can carry the register, and we’ll
come back later and discuss the funeral arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Mrs. Ransome</span> (<em>Takes the marriage register</em>). Oh, Mr. Tanner, I don’t
know how to thank you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Tanner.</span> Well, Mrs. Ransome—I shall expect your husband to send us
something for our new mission to spread Christianity amongst the Chinese.
</p>

<p>
(<em>Exit Tanner and Mrs. Ransome. Janet closes the door. She walks
towards the couch, looks at the prayer-book, then at the couch. She flings
the prayer-book to the other end of the room, smashing some of the ornaments
on the mantle-shelf, and throws herself upon the side of the couch,
sobbing wildly.</em>)

<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> a world where flippancies arrange an effective concealment of beauty
there are still major adventures in beauty to be had beneath the grinning
surface. One of them is the discovery of those rare persons to whom flippancies
are impossible—those splendid persons who take life simply and
greatly. Several months ago I tried to write an impression of Emma Goldman,
from an inadequate background of having merely heard two of her
lectures. Since then I have met her. One realizes dimly that such spirits
live somewhere in the world: history and legend and poetry have proclaimed
them, and at times we hear of their passing; but to meet one on its valiant
journey is like being whirled to some far planet and discovering strange
new glories.
</p>

<p>
Emma Goldman is one of the world’s great people; therefore, it is not
surprising to find her among the despised and rejected. Of course she is
as different from the popular conception of her as anyone could be. The
first thing you feel in meeting her is that indefinable something which all
great and true people have in common—a quality which seems to proceed
on some a priori principle that anything one feels deeply is sublime. Then
a sense of her great humanity sweeps upon you, and the nobility of the
idealist who wrenches her integrity from the grimest depths. A terrible
sadness is in her face—as though the suffering of centuries had concentrated
there in some deep personal struggle; and through it shines that
capacity for joy which becomes colossal in its intensity and tragic in its
disappointments. But the thing which takes your heart in a grip, and
thrusts you quickly into the position of the small boy who longs to die for
the object of his worship, is that imperative gift of motherhood which is
hers and which spends itself with such utter prodigality upon all those who
come to her for inspiration. Emma Goldman has ministered to every kind
of human being from convicts to society women. She has no more idea
of conservation than a lavish springtime; and where she draws courage and
endurance and inspiration for it all will remain one of those mysteries which
only the artist can explain. A mountain-top figure, calm, vast, dynamic,
awful in its loneliness, exalted in its tragedy—this is Emma Goldman, “the
daughter of the dream,” as William Marion Reedy called her in an appreciation
written several years ago. “A dream, you say?” he asked, after
sketching her gospel. “Yes; but life is death without the dream.” In that
rich book of Alexander Berkman’s, <em>Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist</em>, she
is given a better name. “I have always called you the Immutable,” is the
way the author closes one of his letters to her. And this is the quality
which distinguishes Emma Goldman—a kind of eternal staunchness in
which one may put his fundamental trust.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
This is the woman America has hated and persecuted, thrown into jail,
deprived of her citizenship, and held up as an example of all that is ignorant,
coarse, and base. America will recognize its failure some day, after
the brave spirit has done its work—after the spasm of the new war has
ushered in quite simply some of the changes which Emma Goldman has
been pleading for during her years of fighting. But it takes education to
produce such awakenings, and there is no immediate hope of such a general
enlightenment. The stupidity of the situation regarding Emma Goldman
is that other prophets have raised their spears to the same heights and have
been misunderstood or ignored but not outraged by the peculiar ignorance
which Americans alone seem capable of. Had Ibsen appeared among us to
lecture on the rightness of Nora’s rebellion or to denounce the pillars of
society as he did in his writing, he, too, would have been thrown into prison
for free speech or accused of a president’s assassination. The cruelty of
the situation regarding Emma Goldman is that she has so much work to do
which so many people need, and that she cannot break through the prejudice
and the superstition surrounding her to get at those dulled ones who need
it most. Ten years ago she was preaching, under the most absurd persecution,
ideas which thinking people accept as a matter of course today. Now
the ignorant public still shudders at her name; the “intellectuals”—especially
those of the Greenwich Village radical type—dismiss her casually as a sort
of good Christian—one not to be taken too seriously: there are so many
more daring revolutionists among their own ranks that they can’t understand
why Emma Goldman should make such a stir and get all the credit;
the Socialists concede her a personality and condone her failure to attach
herself to that line of evolutionary progress which is sure to establish itself.
“Unscientific” is their damning judgment of her; her Anarchism is a metaphysical
hodge-podge, the outburst of an artistic rather than a scientific
temperament. And so they all miss the real issue, namely, that the chief
business of the prophet is to usher in those new times which often appear
in direct opposition to scientific prediction, and—this above all!—that life
in her has a great grandeur.
</p>

<p>
How do such grotesque misconceptions arise? Why should it have
happened that all this misapprehension and ignorance should have grown
up about a personality whose mere presence is a benediction and whose
friendship compels you toward high goals you had thought unattainable?
There is no use asking how or why it happened; it is a perfectly consistent
thing to have happened, for it happens to everyone, in greater or less degree,
who strives for a new ideal. But if I could only get hold of all the people
who are unwilling to understand Emma Goldman and <em>force</em> them to listen
to her for an hour:—what a sweet triumph comes with their “Oh, but she’s
wonderful!”
</p>

<p>
And now about her ideas. If you have read Wilde’s <em>Soul of Man
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
Under Socialism</em> you know the essence of Emma Goldman’s Anarchism.
What is there about it to cause an epidemic of terror? It is merely the highest
ideal of human conduct that has ever been evolved. Well, it is possible
to get even the prejudiced to admit this much. Nearly everyone can see
that government in its essence is tyranny; that one human being’s authority
over another is a degrading thing; that no man should have the power to
force his neighbor into a dungeon on the flimsy pretext that punishment is
a prevention and a protection; that no man should dare to take the life of
another man, on any basis whatever; that crime is really misdirected energy
and “criminal types” usually sick people who should be treated as such;
that “abnormal” people are those who have not found their work; that people
who work should have some share of their production; that the holding
of property is a source of many evils; that possessiveness and “bargaining”
are mean qualities; that co-operation and sharing are splendid ones; that
there should be an equality between giving and taking; that nothing worth
while was ever born outside of freedom; and that men <em>might</em> live together
on this basis more effectively than on the present one. Even your “reasonable”
man will grant you this premise; but then he plays his trump card:
It may all be very beautiful—of course it is; <em>but it can never happen</em>! Oscar
Wilde answered him in this way: “Is this Utopian? A map of the world
that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out
the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity
lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail.
Progress is the realization of Utopias.”
</p>

<p>
Emma Goldman believes this. She does not belong with the rank and
file of Anarchists. Cults and “isms” are too restrictive for her. “But you
are an extreme Individualist,” the Socialists tell her. “No, I am not,” she
answers them. “I hate your rigid Anglo-Saxon individualism. It is just
because I am so deeply social that I put my hope in the individual.” It is
because she hates injustice of any sort so passionately that she adopted
Anarchism as the soundest method of combating it. If you have laws you
must accept the abuses of law. Why not be more completely simple—why
keep on pretending that we need a machinery which fosters tyrannies instead
of giving freedom an unhandicapped path to begin upon its great
responsibilities? This was the idealism upon which the American founders
built—a minimum of government, at least, when that evil seemed to become
a necessity. In her remarkable book that has just been published, Voltarine
de Cleyre discusses this phase of the matter brilliantly in a chapter called
“Anarchism and American Traditions.” There is no possibility of going
into it minutely here, except to ask those who insist upon regarding Anarchism
as an unconstructive force to read it.
</p>

<p>
These are the things Emma Goldman is trying to preach. She does not
expect to see a new order spring up in response to her vision; so the facetious
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
ones who poke their stale jokes at the unspeakable humor of a communistic
society might save their wit for more legitimate provocations. All
she hopes is to quicken the consciousness of those through whom such
changes will come—to improve the individual quality. It reminds you of
Comte’s suggestion, at the time when he fell deliriously in love, that all the
problems of society could be solved on that divine principle. It is like
Tolstoy’s dream prophecy—his prediction of the time when there will be
neither monogamy nor polygamy, but simply a poetogamy under which people
may live freely and beautifully.
</p>

<p>
And so Emma Goldman continues her work, talking passionately to
crowds of people, sickened by audiences who listen merely out of curiosity,
disheartened by the vapid applause of those who make their own incapacities
the burden of their rebellion, heartbroken by the masses who cannot respond
to any ideal, cheered by the few who understand, dedicated to an eternal
hope of new values. This is the real Emma Goldman—a visionist, if you
will, but at the same time a woman with a deep faith in the superiority of
reality to imagination. How she has lived life! How gallantly she makes
the big out of the little and accepts without complaining the perverted role
which has been thrust at her. To have seen her in her home with its hundreds
of books and its charming old pictures of Ibsen and Tolstoy and
Nietzsche and Kropotkin; to have seen her friends, her nephews and nieces
offering her their high adoration; to have watched her gigantic tenderness,
her gorgeous flinging away of self on every possible pretext; to have
listened with her to great music in a kind of cosmic hush that music is
made by and for such spirits; to have heard her, “the crucified,” talk of the
ideal she cherishes and how her expression of it has been so far below her
dream; to have compared her, an artist in life, as incapable of spiritual vulgarity
as a Rodin or a Beethoven, with a sensitiveness which makes her
almost fear beauty, with a sweetness that is overwhelming—to compare her
with the vulgarians who denounce her is to fall into a mad rage and long
to insult them desperately. I said before that Emma Goldman was the most
challenging spirit in America. But she is so much more than that: she is
many wonderful things which this article merely touches upon, because it
is impossible to express them all.

The Spiritual Dangers of Writing
Vers Libre
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Eunice Tietjens</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> spiritual dangers that beset a struggling poet are almost as numerous
as his creditors, and quite as rampant. And woe unto him who falls a
prey to any one of them! For poetry, being the immediate reflection of
the spiritual life of its author, degenerates more quickly than almost any
other form of human expression when this inner life goes astray.
</p>

<p>
There is first of all the danger of sentimentality, an ever-present, sticky
danger that awaits patiently and imperturbably and has to be met afresh
every day. True, if the poet yields to this danger and embraces it skillfully
enough, the creditors aforementioned may sometimes be paid and much
adulation acquired into the bargain—witness Ella Wheeler Wilcox—but it
is at the price of artistic death.
</p>

<p>
There is the danger of giving the emotions too free rein, of producing,
as Arthur Davison Ficke has said in a former number of <span class="smallcaps">The Little</span>
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
<span class="smallcaps">Review</span>, merely “an inarticulate cry of emotion” which moves us like “the
crying of a child.” Much of our sex poetry is of this type. On the other
hand, there is the equally present danger of becoming over-intellectualized—of
drying up and blowing away before the wind of human vitality. Edmund
Clarence Stedman went that way. Then there is the danger of determined
modernity, of resolutely setting out to be “vital” at all costs and crystallizing
into mere frozen impetuosity, as Louis Untermeyer has done—and the other
danger of dwelling professorially in the past with John Myers O’Hara.
There is too the new danger of “cosmicality,” of which John Alford amusingly
accuses our American poets of to-day. And there are many, many
other pitfalls that the unsuspecting poet must meet and bridge before he can
hope to win to the heights of immortality.
</p>

<p>
But there seems to be a whole new set of dangers, especially virulent,
that attend the writing of <em>vers libre</em>, free verse, polyrhythmics, or whatever
else one may choose to call the free form so prevalent to-day. These dangers
are inherent in the form itself and are directly traceable to it. For contrary
to the general notion on the subject, it takes a better balanced intellect to
write good <em>vers libre</em> than to write in the old verse forms. It is essentially
an art for the sophisticated, and the tyro will do well to avoid it.
</p>

<p>
The first of these dangers, and the one in which all the others take root,
is a very insidious peril, and few there be who escape it. It is the danger
of being obvious.
</p>

<p>
In writing rhymed or even rhymeless poetry of a conventional rhythmical
pattern the mind is constantly obliged to sift and sort the various images
which present themselves—to test them, and turn them this way and that,
as one does pieces in a mosaic, till they at last fit more or less perfectly into
the pattern. This process, although it sometimes, owing to the physical
formation of the language, distorts the poet’s meaning a little, has the great
artistic advantage of eliminating many casual first associations, which on
careful thought are found not worth saying. It is precisely this winnowing,
weighing process which the form of free verse lacks. Anything that comes
to mind can be said at once, and with a little instinct for rhythm, is said.
The result of this mental laziness is that the ideas expressed are often
obvious.
</p>

<p>
But here a curious phenomenon of the human mind comes into play.
Just as a physically lazy man will often perform great mental exertions to
avoid moving, so the mind will frequently go to quite as great lengths to find
unusual methods of expression to conceal, even from itself, this laziness
of first thinking. The result is the attempt to cover with words the fundamental
paucity of the ideas.
</p>

<p>
There are several principal effects which may result from this. One
is brutality. A conception which, if spoken simply, is at once recognized as
trite, may if said brutally enough pass muster as surprising and “strong.”
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
A crude illustration of this is to be found in the recent war poetry of “mangled
forms” and “gushing entrails.” Ezra Pound furnishes the most perfect
example. Another effect is the tendency to the grotesque. This device
is more successful in deceiving the poet himself than the other, though it has
less general appeal. For it is possible, by making a thing grotesque enough,
to cover almost completely the underlying conception. Skipwith Cannéll
runs this danger, along with lesser men. A third peril is that which besets
some of the Imagistes—the danger of reducing the idea to a minimum and
relying entirely on the sound and color of the words to carry the poem.
</p>

<p>
Still another result of the complete loosening of the reins possible in
<em>vers libre</em> is the immediate enlargement of the ego. It is not so easy to see
why this should result, but it almost invariably does, and has since the days
of Whitman. It usually goes to-day with the effect of brutality. The universe
divides itself at once into two portions, of which the poet is by far the
greater half. “I”—“I”—“I” they say, and again “I”—“I”—“I.” And having
said it they appear to be vastly relieved.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to lay about them gallantly at every person or tendency
that has ever annoyed them. “I have been abused” they say, “I have been
neglected! You intolerable Philistines, I will get back at you!” It is odd
that it never seems to occur to these young men that they can only hit those
persons who read them, and that every person who reads them is at least a
prospective friend. Those who neglect them they can never reach—and
slapping one’s friends is an unprofitable amusement.
</p>

<p>
Examples of these unfortunate spiritual results of abandoning oneself
too recklessly to the free verse form are numerous. James Oppenheim’s
latest volume, <em>Songs for the New Age</em>—although it is in many ways an
excellent work and deserves endorsement by all who really belong to the
new age and are not merely accidentally alive to-day—nevertheless shows
in places the tendency to obviousness and slack work.
</p>

<p>
More flagrant examples are to be found elsewhere. Take for instance
Orrick Johns. Here are some stanzas from his long poem, <em>Second Avenue</em>,
which took the prize in Mitchell Kennerley’s <em>Lyric Year</em>:

<p class="noindent">
The same Orrick Johns wrote this blatant bit of free verse in <em>Poetry</em>
a few months later. Both the paucity of ideas and the enlarged ego are very
well shown here:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

      <p class="verse">It costs me nothing to be kind;</p>
      <p class="verse">If I am a generous adversary, be not deceived, neither be devoted—</p>
      <p class="verse">It is because I despise you.</p>

But to see the tendencies of which we have spoken in their most exaggerated
form it is necessary to go to Ezra Pound, the young self-expatriated
American who wails because “that ass, my country, has not employed me.”
His earlier work was clean-cut, sensitive poetry, some of it very beautiful.
This for example:

To attempt to lay the entire onus of so flagrant a spiritual and cerebral
degeneration to the writing of <em>vers libre</em> alone is of course impossible. But
the tendency is clear. Fortunately, however, we are not all Ezra Pounds
and there are still poets balanced enough to appreciate these dangers and to
make of free verse the wonderful vehicle it can be in the hands of a genius.

(<em>Translated from the French by Anne Simon</em>)
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> want to explain to you the difference between Futurism and Anarchism.
</p>

<p>
Anarchism, denying the infinite principle of human evolution, suspends
its impulse at the ideal threshold of universal peace, and before the
stupid paradise of interlocked embraces in the open fields and midst the
waving of palms.
</p>

<p>
We, the Futurists, on the contrary, affirm as one of our absolute principles
the continuous growth and the unlimited physiological and intellectual
progress of Man.
</p>

<p>
We aim beyond the hypothesis of the amicable fusion of the different
races, and we admit the only possible hygiene of the World: War.
</p>

<p>
The distant goal of the anarchistic conception (a kind of sweet tenderness,
sister to baseness) appears to us as an impure gangrene preluding
the agony of the races.
</p>

<p>
The anarchists are satisfied in attacking the political, judicial, and economical
branches of the social tree. We strive to do much more than that.
We want to uproot and burn its very deepest roots; those that are planted in
the brain of man, and are called:
</p>

<p>
Mania for order.
</p>

<p>
The desire for the least effort.
</p>

<p>
The fanatical adoration of the family.
</p>

<p>
The undue stress laid on sleep, and the repast at a fixed hour.
</p>

<p>
Cowardly acquiescence or quietism.
</p>

<p>
Love for the antique and the old.
</p>

<p>
The unwise preservation of everything that is wicked and sick.
</p>

<p>
The horror of the new.
</p>

<p>
Contempt for youth.
</p>

<p>
Contempt for rebellious minorities.
</p>

<p>
The veneration for time, for accumulated years, for the dead, and for
the dying.
</p>

<p>
The instinctive need of laws, chains, and impediments.
</p>

<p>
Horror of violence.
</p>

<p>
Horror of the unknown and the new.
</p>

<p>
Fear of a total liberty.
</p>

<p>
Have you never seen an assemblage of young revolutionaries or anarchists?...
<em>Eh bien</em>: there is no more discouraging spectacle.
</p>

<p>
You would observe that the urgent, immediate mania, in these red souls,
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
is to deprive themselves quickly of their vehement independence, to give the
government of their party to the oldest of their number; that is to say, to the
greatest opportunist, to the most prudent, in a word, to the one who having
already acquired a little force, and a little authority, will be fatally interested
in conserving the present state of things, in calming violence, in
opposing all desire for adventure, for risk, and heroism.
</p>

<p>
This new president, while guiding them in the general discussion with
apparent equity, shall lead them like sheep to the fold of his personal interest.
</p>

<p>
Do you still believe seriously in the usefulness or desirability of conventions
of revolutionary spirits?
</p>

<p>
Content yourself then, with choosing a director, or, better still, a
leader of discussion. Choose for that post the youngest amongst you, the
least known, the least important; only his role must never supersede the
simple distribution of the word, with an absolute equality of time that he
shall control, the watch in his hand.
</p>

<p>
But that which digs the deepest ditch between the futuristic and anarchistic
conception, is the great problem of love, with its great tyranny of
sentiment and lust, from which we want to extricate humanity.

</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> is a discovery, by no means pleasing or edifying, that the student
makes as he broadly surveys the history of humanity. All the great turning-points
of that history seem to be inwardly associated with violent upheavals
and fearful revolutions. And of all these revolutions, it may be doubted
whether history records any one on so large a scale as that which confronts
us under the name of Christianity, in the transition from ancient to mediæval
ecclesiastical culture. It was not a single Crucified One that gave Christianity
the sacred symbol of its religion; unnumbered thousands—mostly slaves—breathed
out their poor lives on martyrs’ crosses. The old culture went
down in rivers of blood—not too figuratively meant—and a new arose, or,
better, was created. Now, what is true of this most important revolution
of our antecedent cultural life is true also, in corresponding measure, of every
new “becoming” in the history of peoples. No state, no church, no social
form, has ever arisen but that the path of the new life has passed over ruins
and graves.
</p>

<p>
Must this be so? Must it be eternally so? Is it a thing of historical
inevitability, is it even a law of the very order of the world itself? The
answer—first answer, at all events—is, Yes! To affirm itself, to persist as
life,—this belongs as nothing else does to life’s very nature. What newly
arises negates what has already arisen. All that is living pronounces a sentence
of death upon all that has been alive and that now sets itself against
the new life. Accordingly, we are wont to call life a struggle for existence.
Old Greeks coined a phrase, <em>Polemos pater panton</em>: war is the father of all
things. The right to life is the right of the strong.
</p>

<p>
In view of these things, may we fairly raise the question as to whether
there are exceptions to so universal a rule? Were we to set up a different
right, would it not be the right of the weak? Would it not be to make the
sick and the infirm masters over the well and the strong? Would it not be
to preach a decadent morality as do all the pusillanimous and the hirelings
who beg for the protection of their weakness because they do not have the
strength to drive and force their way through life?
</p>

<p>
The man who, for a generation, has been called the prophet of a new
culture, this <em>Friedrich Nietzsche</em>, is he not, then, precisely the apostle of this
man of might and mastery, of ill-famed <em>Herrnmoral</em>, master’s morality,
especially? Napoleon, his Messiah—do you think? Did he not gloat and
glory over the time when the wild roving <em>blonde Bestie</em> was still alive in the
old Germans? Did he not worship the beast of prey, memorialize the murderer,
stigmatize the morality of Christianity as a crime against life, because
of its saying, Blessed are the poor and the sick, the peaceable and the meek?
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
If, now, the word of this new prophet should make disciples, should even
revolutionize the times, should we close our churches and stop our preaching,
as the first thing to be done? For the churches preach goodness and love,
not might and dominion; see in man child of God, not beast of prey.
</p>

<p>
If all this were a partisan matter—for or against Nietzsche—I would
have nothing to do with it. To join in the damnatory fulminations against
this man, or to advertise mitigating circumstances for his thought, and to
re-interpret the whole from such a standpoint, until the whole should seem
less brutal and less dangerous—to do either the one or the other is not for
me, but for those polemicists and irenicists who are adding to the gayety
of nations in these otherwise heartbreaking times, by the high debate as to
whether Nietzsche be both the efficient and the final cause of our present
world war. Not to defend Nietzsche, not to condemn him, but to wrestle
for a firm, clear, moral view of life in our seething times, this alone is most
worth while, and this too is my task.
</p>

<p>
But for all that, I do believe we must penetrate much, much deeper
into this new prophet’s spirit than either friend or foe has yet done, if we
are to win from Nietzsche a deepening of our own and our time’s moral
view of life.
</p>

<p>
Would that we might forget, for a moment at least, all that partisan
praise and blame have scraped together respecting this most modern of all
philosophers; would that we might accompany him into the most hidden
workshop of his own thoughts and hearken to the personal confessions of
his wonderful soul! And what would we hear there? This preacher of
crash and catastrophe and cataclysm, temporal and eternal, speaking of
“thoughts which come with dove’s feet and steer and pilot the world”; of
“the stillest hours which bring the storm.” Zarathustra-Nietzsche hears
the <em><a id="corr-10"></a>Höllenlärm</em>, the hellish alarum, that men make in life, that life itself
makes; he observes how men lend their ears to this noise, how they are
frightened by it, or exult over it, how they think that the truth is the truer
where the noise is the louder, how the howling of the storm signifies to men
that something good and great must be taking place, some great event of
history must be under way. Then Nietzsche sets himself like a flint against
this evaluation of things: “The greatest experiences, these are not our
noisiest, but our stillest hours. It is not around the inventor of new noise,
it is around the inventor of new values that the world revolves, inaudibly
revolves.” I speak for myself alone, but these are words, Nietzsche words,
for which I would gladly sacrifice whole volumes of moral and theological
works. These words sharpen the eye and the ear for life-values which the
majority of men today pass by—pass by more heedlessly perhaps than ever.
These great words supply us with a criterion for the evaluation of questions
of the moral life, a criterion that no one will cast aside who once comes to
see what it means. It is a criterion without which we do not yet comprehend
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
life in its depths, because we so constantly contemplate things from a false
angle of vision. Something of the men who are carried away by “hellish
alarum” lives in all of us. Let there be stillness without, and we think that
there is nothing going on. Let nature peal and groan outside there, so that
all gigantic forces seem to be released; then we have respect for her, we
discern in such over-power even a divine creative force or a divine destructive
will. Let people collide, the earth quake from thunder of cannon, and we
signalize such a day in our history, pass it down from child to child, and we
call such and such a battle a world-historical event.
</p>

<p>
But we forget the best. A blustering and brewing pervades nature
when Spring comes over the land to conquer Winter. When we hear the
conflict we cry: “Spring has come!” Not so. The true, genuine Spring-life,
nascent underneath the fury, makes no noise at all, weaves away inaudibly,
invisibly, in tiny seeds, and conceals in itself the noiseless new
germs of life.

But the chief study of mankind is still man, not nature and the gods.
Man’s silences! Yes, amid the smoke of powder and clink of swords,
peoples slash each other; and the men who make such uproar the people
call great. But the might and work of a people are to be found in that
quiet heroism, of which no one can discern anything outwardly—that quiet
heroism to which no one can unveil monuments in our cities. It is the inaudible
battles of the heart that this heroism fights; and the quieter it is,
the more gloriously it shines. Men with big voices and mighty lungs we
hear. Their words excite, move to tears, arouse boisterous and voluble
antagonisms. These who assemble about them such billowy mobs, we are
tempted to think that they are the leading spirits, that a vast power must live
in them, since they are so able to move inert men. But another prophet,
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
modern also, has said to these bawlers in market places: “Do you think
that he who stirs up scandal moves the world?” Nothing easier than to
start a scandal! Also, nothing jollier for numerous men, to say nothing of
women. But scandal is a roaring in the ears. It does not reach the heart.
It irritates, over-irritates the nerves. It creates no blessings, no life. A tiny
word that sinks down into the deep of the soul, and quietly does its work
there of germinating and sprouting—this means infinitely more for the world
than the “alarum” of all the professional and unprofessional bawlers. Deep
rivers make least din. Light cares speak; mighty griefs are dumb. A heart
must be profane indeed, in which there is nothing sacred to silence and the
solemn sea. Once more, to quote Carlyle: “Under all speech that is good
for anything lies a silence that is better. Silence is deep as eternity; speech
is shallow as time.”
</p>

It were well to begin at home, and learn to evaluate experience aright in
our own being. There are moments in our lives when everything that we
encounter disconcerts us; nay, when our whole being seems to be off the
hinges, out of joint. Pain plows up our innermost selves. We could shriek
from heartbreak and woe. We stand there undone. And men who see us
and hear us moaning so piteously, groaning so painfully, have the feeling:
“No pain like this!” But how mistaken they are! For there is a cry of the
soul, heard of no one, more painful than all that can be pitied or lamented.
There are labors and battles of the soul wherein nothing is hammered and
driven, and yet <em>something new</em> is formed. It is never so still in a man as
when he makes up his mind to have done inwardly with some experience.
As long as there is foaming and blustering within, we accomplish nothing.
True work tolerates no tempest. We must be still. And when old values
are broken, when we must lead life to new goals, the quiet hour must come
in which a divine child of the spirit is conceived by the holy spirit; and the
brightest light which we can kindle within will burn so quietly and clearly
that no cloud of smoke shall ascend therefrom, and there shall be no flickering
to bear witness of contact with the restless world. “There the true Silence
is, self-conscious and alone.”
</p>

<p>
Behold, then, this Nietzsche, who flees all “alarum” and execrates all
din as a falsification of the moral values of life; who lives preferably thousands
of feet above the world there below, who lingers on the loftiest lands
of life whither no whirring rattle of the day could rise! Could this
Nietzsche find joy in men mauling and making a mess of each other? Could
this Nietzsche preach a culture in which battalions in uniform should line
up against those in blouse to see who knew best how to deal the deadly blow?
Could he gloat over the field where the thunder of battle thundered the
loudest? “Inventor” Krupp’s “new noise”—would that appeal to Nietzsche
who wanted all silent save the dripping rain, and who worshipped sunshine
alone? One might answer these questions in the light of one’s own experience.
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
Let us suppose that we comprehend the meaning of the <em>stillsten Stunden</em>,
the quietest hours, and the worth of those great happenings of which
nothing reaches the newspapers, and which no <em>avant-coureur</em> trumpets. Tell
me, could we then detect even the slightest inclination to be our own heralds,
and to sacrifice our quietest hours to the gaping and squabbling of men?
Men—so the old gospels say—ought not to cast their pearls before swine,
or give that which is holy to the dogs. But what is pearl, what is holy, if
not what the Nietzschean still hour contains and produces? There is something
so tender and beautiful in that hour that we shrink from expressing it,
from translating it into thought, lest word and thought tincture its best perfume.
Silence is sweeter than speech, more musical than song. Whoever
has a deep in himself into which he alone descends and penetrates, a <em>plus</em>
of his life that remains after we have known and weighed all his words and
deeds, protects this deep and this <em>plus</em> from everything that could make a
noise, from all mere words, from all intrusive and obtrusive tittle-tattle.
<em>Sich eine Oberfläche anheucheln</em>, to feign a surface, to wear a mask, this is
the original and fine insight into such psychology. Man envelops himself
in unneighborliness, not to hold haughtily other men away from him, but
to save himself from them, so that they may not clumsily finger some pearl
which could not stand so rude a touch. Why speak in parables? Because
it is not given unto them to know the mystery of the kingdom, said the
Nazarene. Parables were a protecting shell encasing the most intimate
kernel, which ignorance or awkwardness might otherwise corrupt or destroy.
Nietzsche and the Nazarene held a deep and a <em>plus</em> so uniquely their own
that they intentionally sought, not to be understood, but to be misunderstood,
with reference thereto.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there is a “surface” which only the man knows and uses who bears
about a deep in his own being. There, hypocrisy becomes a protection of
truthfulness; surface a protection of depth. Whoever “feigns such surface,”
wears such mask, is infinitely more honest and veracious than he who
has no silence in his deep which cannot be speech on his tongue—a speech
which is often only motions and noises of the tongue of him who pries
curiously into what he is inwardly incompetent to understand, or offers a
superficial and voluble sympathy for griefs of which he is as innocent as
a babe unborn, or a jaunty appreciation of values and verities and virtues for
which he has never sweat even a drop of blood. To wear a mask, to lie, lie,
lie,—that is the <em>truth</em> of the soul as it hides its treasures and its sanctities
from vulgarity and volubility!

<p class="noindent">
Thus, it is the Deep, the Unique, the Abyss within, that is the great Isolator.
Nietzsche was indeed “the eagle that long, long gazeth benumbed into
abysses, into <em>its own</em> abysses!”
</p>

<p>
And he spoke in parables. Give heed—so Zarathustra counsels his
disciples—to the times when your spirits speak in parables, for in these
times is the origin of your virtue.
</p>

<p>
I said I would not vindicate Nietzsche. But what if his deification of
force-humanity, of master-humanity, were <em>Oberfläche</em>, “surface,” mask,
which he “feigned” or wore, in order to protect his pearls from sows, his
holy of holies from hounds? What if <em>this</em>—scandalizing the scandalous!—were
but picture and parable which Nietzsche flaunted to the people that
they might wreak their vengeance thereupon? And the parable is so pertinently
chosen that it says everything to men of sense and seriousness, hides
everything from fools; that the pearls can be recognized if right eyes behold,
but protectingly concealed from rude eyes and awkward hands.
</p>

<p>
Of course, Nietzsche was a homicide! So must we be! If thy right
eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; if thy right hand offend
thee, hew it off, and cast it from thee. And there are things more offensive
than an eye or a hand! These are the weaknesses which we pamper and
grow in ourselves: thought-lessness which we wink at; old pet habits which
have come to be just too dear for anything, especially for us to knife; above
all, sickly sentiments, self-pity, from which even all our joys cannot rescue
us—so that we do not have the courage to join those warriors who turn
their weapons against their own selves, and to swear an “<em>I will</em>,” that is
hard as steel, against all these softnesses and humors and self-commiserations.
Surely, it were well to be force-men, master-men, so that we would
not coddle our impotency or carry on a pleasure-pain play with our weakness.
</p>

<p>
Yes, in these “stillest hours” there is also a “still” homicide and interment,
a plucking out and a hacking off, and the warrior-hero does not betray
the least pathos as he does this—there is no plaintive note in his voice. The
greatest thing about the dying Socrates, sipping away at his cup of hemlock,
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
was the total absence of pathos and self-pity. Ah, if we but took half the
pains to marshal forces of will in ourselves, that we now devote to conserving
our weak wills, and to adducing all sorts of plausible reasons for their
impuissance! If we but actually learned <em>Herrenmoral</em>, master-<a id="corr-11"></a>morality, that
were indeed masterful and understood mastership! We are called to be masters
by our creator, not only masters of the earth, but also masters of the
spirit. And mastership is a great sacred thing, which we ought to learn
from world-masters. We ought to be hammers in life and not anvils. The
great calamity among men is that they shrink from being hammers, and
call the virtue of the anvil that lets itself be struck by the name of “patience.”
</p>

<p>
It is just not true that Christianity abhors master-morality and preaches
a <em><a id="corr-12"></a>Sclavenmoral</em>, a slave-morality. Yes it <em>is</em> true of the cowardly and inert
thing that men call Christianity, this religion of the study-chair and the
barracks which can make use of no master, because it summons just those
powers to rule whose whole strength consists only in the weakness of others.
But there <em>is</em> a Christianity which has been outright mighty force, outright
master-instinct, this kingly Christianity, in whose presence a Pilate, and a
Herod, with the entire host of their war-slaves, were feeble folk indeed; a
Christianity of love and gentleness and meekness,—aye, aye, sir! But one
can have gentleness in the heart,—and yet lay on with a club! That was
indeed master-morality when the Son of Man made himself master of the
Sabbath; when he with a whip of cords scourged the money-changers and
mammonists out of the Temple! That was a force-man and a master-man
who hurled his, “Get thee behind me, Satan!” against the weak heart of
Peter.
</p>

<p>
How would it do for our churches to have a new festival, a festival of
“the stillest hour,” memorializing the “invention of new values, around which
the world revolves, noiselessly revolves”? Noises enough, often enough
<em>Höllenlärm</em>, have there been in our churches, are yet, God knows! But it is
not noise that rules the world. It is stillness which ultimately is the spiritual
and moral might of the men who will possess the kingdom of earth.
What if even the history of peoples “feigns a surface,” wears a mask, for
those who having eyes see not, having ears hear not? What if men mistake
<em>Höllenlärm</em> for messages of great occurrences in history, and on this account
hold themselves aloof from those phenomena and experiences in which
<em>something new</em>, a life of the heart, presses on to its birth-hour? Yet the
human race will not always need or require noise and masks as its history
rolls on. The more men kill what is really worthy of death, the less will
they set out to kill each other. The more powerfully the will becomes conscious
of its calling to master, the more strenuously men strive after greatness,
human greatness, the more ridiculous will it come to seem to them
in the course of time that the force of man should be sought in the force of
his muscles, the mastership of man in the hoarded prerogative of powder
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
and lead. The day will yet come—as come it shall—when we will estimate
our life, not according to its noisiest, but according to its stillest hours.
And then a great and pure life will be created by what is done in the heart
of man.

<h3 class="section" id="WHY_SOCIALISTS_WENT_TO_WAR">
<em>Why Socialists Went to War</em>
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">e</span> have listened with much interest to the excuses for the
German Socialists who went to war, as well as to the attacks
on them for doing so. Now, though hesitating to obtrude
our ignorance into the muddle of a complicated discussion, we
can’t refrain from offering a suggestion.
</p>

<p>
The bottom reason for sudden activity under the stress of unusual
circumstances is to be found, not in a conscious mental decision,
but in the previously-formed habits of the individual mind. We are
referring partly to the mob-emotion which has swept away so many
even of the greatest souls of Europe. We are thinking more of
the essence of Socialism, and the sort of emotional method which
has been produced among its adherents—the material upon which
mob-psychology had to work.
</p>

<p>
There is no essential difference between the method of German
Imperialism and the method of German Socialism; the only difference
lies in the objectives. Both insist on the supreme importance
of the state, both work through cohesive organization and the almost
unquestioning following of leaders. The habit of obedience, the
instinct for organization, the gregarious mode of action—these are
the very qualities of the individual German which have made it possible
for the German Social Democratic Party to grow to such size
and strength. What more inevitable, when the mobilization order
went up, when flags flew and drums beat, than that the individual
German Socialist should in his excitement shoulder his gun and
march to war?
</p>

<p>
Of course, we don’t really know anything about it, and we
haven’t the resources to make anything like a scientific investigation.
But we strongly suspect that the morals of organized humanity will
remain inferior to the morals of the individual until the individual
habit of mind becomes one which denies to organized humanity
supreme authority over the will.

<h3 class="section" id="ANOTHER_NEW_POET">

<em>Another New Poet</em>
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">r.</span> Scharmel Iris is a young Italian poet, born in Florence,
who at the tender age of ten, and later, was praised by Ruskin,
Swinburne, Francis Thompson, Edmund Gosse, and other men who
may be assumed to know what good poetry is. Ruskin wrote: “He
is a youth of genius and his poems are marvelously beautiful. His
heart has felt the pathos of life and he has set this pathos to music.”
Swinburne said: “He writes with imaginative ardor, and impassioned
is the word which best illustrates his utterance. He is genuine
and sincere, and his lovely poems display energy of emotion and a
true sense of poetic restraint.” Thompson was more superlative:
“I believe Scharmel Iris to be a poet of the first rank,” he stated.
“His poems are sublime in conception, rich in splendid imagery, full
of remarkable metaphors and new figures, and musical in expression.”
Of course it has been difficult for a young man of such talent
to find a publisher or a public; but at last a volume of his work
is to be brought out by the Ralph Fletcher Seymour Company. The
book will be called <em>Lyrics of a Lad</em>, and will be ready about Christmas
time. Beside a preface by Maurice Francis Egan and an interesting
title-page decoration by Michele Greco, it will have a frontispiece
portrait by Eugene R. Hutchinson, the photographer who
should never be referred to by any noun except “artist.” Personally,
we love Mr. Iris’s work; we use the verb thoughtfully, because
his poetry is not merely the sort which interests or attracts; it remains
in your mind as part of that art treasure-house which is your
religion and your life.

<em>Prizes for Poetry</em>
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> interesting announcement comes from <em>Poetry</em> in regard
to two prize offers. One—the Helen Haire Levinson prize of
two hundred dollars for the best poetry by a citizen of the United
States published in the magazine during its second year—has been
awarded to Mr. Carl Sandburg for his <em>Chicago Poems</em>. This is a
particularly gratifying decision, for Mr. Sandburg’s is a new voice
which must be reckoned with in American poetic production. The
second is a one hundred dollar offer for the best war or peace poem
on the present European situation, and has been given to Miss Louise
Driscoll of Catskill, New York, for a poem called <em>Metal Checks</em>,
which appears in the November issue.

My Friend, the Incurable
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> dusk I pass an ugly red building with shrieking fat black letters on
its façade—Home for Incurables. Shrill grass, narcotic carnations, hazy
figures in rocking chairs and on the balconies, melting in the liquid gold of
autumn twilight—a harmony of discord that screams for the spiritual brush
of Kandinsky. There are no signs of pain or grief on the faces of the
doomed: a profound calmness they bear, a resolute quiescence, reminding us
of Dante after he had seen hell or of Andreyev’s resurrected Lazarus. “To
be sure, they are quite happy,” explained the obliging Doctor. “These men
and women have come to be free of struggles, of doubts, and of the anguish
of hopes. The knowledge of their fate, the ultimate, irrevocable truth, is a
relieving balm for the tired spirits—nay, even for the hopeless bodies, for as
soon as they cease fighting their disease they learn to adapt themselves to
that disease, to consider it an inseparable part of their existence. I can show
you a number of patients who are actually in love with their affliction, who
would resent the idea of being turned normal. Look at the hilarious face of
that fellow yonder at the fountain; he is intoxicated with sunset, and appears
to be the happiest of mortals, despite his terrible disease. A queer case, an
un-American case.”
</p>

<p>
The doctor uttered a fearful Latin term and told me the history of that
patient. A European, he has been for many years afflicted with something
like “sentimentalomania,” a peculiarly Continental ailment. Skilful physicians
had tried in vain to cure him; change of climate and environment had
been of no avail: even in Siberian tundras and in foggy London his disposition
remained unaltered. In despair he went to Berlin, where, he was advised,
the gravest case of sentimentality would be annihilated; the reaction
proved almost fatal, for the Spree and the <em>Sieges Allee</em> made such a nauseating
impression upon the poor fellow that his illness was complicated by a
severe outbreak of Germanophobia. As a last resort, the famous specialist,
Herr Dr. Von Bierueberalles, bade him taste the influence of the sanest atmosphere
on earth, that of the States. When even the harshest and most practical
American treatment had failed to knock out the unfortunate’s folly,
he was pronounced hopeless and offered a place among the incurables, which
offer he willingly accepted, and acquiesced. He has since become accustomed
to his disease and bears it rather with defiant joy.
</p>

<p>
At times, when I seek relief from practical values and sane standards,
I come to have a chat with my friend, the Incurable. Henceforth he will
have the floor.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
With whom do I side in the War? Why, of course, with Germany! Perhaps
my attitude shows that I have not been completely cured from the
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
Prussophobia that I had contracted in Berlin; as it is, I sincerely wish to see
the German boot victorious on the whole continent and over the mouldy Britons,
a rude, dreamless, wingless Napoleon brooding over old napping
Europe. Picture the ruined cathedrals of Belgium and France “restored”
into comfortable barracks for the braves of the Fatherland; picture the boulevards
of Paris and Brusselles, the quays of the Neva and the Thames,
ornated with the statues of the most Christian Wilhelm and of his illustrious
ancestors down to the Great Elector of Brandenburg; picture the excellent
<em>Schutzman</em> reigning supreme, physically and spiritually, from Vladivostock
to Glasgow,—think what an abyss of hatred, of stirring electrifying hatred
will arise among the rotting nations, and out of hatred self consciousness,
endeavors, cravings, to be crystallized in torrents of new art creations! As
for Germany, I have no fear for the duration of her hegemony; she will undoubtedly
choke from indigestion. But oh, how I dread the reverse outcome!
The victory of the Allies will push Progress a century backward; it will
strengthen the tottering absolutism in Russia; it will swell the piggish arrogance
of the French bourgeois; it will augment the insular hypocricity of the
English Philistine; it will still more, if it is possible, vulgarize international
diplomacy and greed, arousing the appetites of the so-called Democracies.
</p>

<p>
Democracy—who was it that recently stated with charming aplomb
that “Individualism and democracy are synonymous terms?” Yes, I recall:
it came from the pen of the author of <em>Incense and Splendor</em> and <em>To the Innermost</em>.
I confess this statement, especially when considering its authorship,
came to me as a revelation. To me the word “democracy,” as many another
beautiful word, has lost its original lofty meaning and has come to rhyme
with mediocrity, with the strangling of the Few of the Mountain by the
Many of the Valley. Could you name many great things that the most
democratized countries, like America and Switzerland, have produced outside
of Schweitzer-cheese and Victrolas? Has there ever been a great individualist
who appeared as a child of his age, as an outgrowth and a reflection
of a democracy? I do not know of such instances. Of course, I grant that
the writer of that statement put into the word “Democracy” a higher, a more
idealistic meaning. Words, like music, like practically every medium of art,
express the author’s personality, and, provided he is an artist, he binds us to
share his interpretation. Take, for example, that popular song, “<em>Oh, You
Beautiful Doll</em>”; apparently there is nothing tragic in it, yet my emotions
were stirred when I heard its French interpretation by Olga Petrova (it was
before the kind American entrepreneurs had forced her to perform stunts
in Panthea). She had managed to put so much sorrow and tenderness into
“<em>O Ma Grande Belle Poupée!</em>” that one forgot the triteness of the words
and felt gripping sadness. Or take a less vulgar illustration—Gertrude
Stein’s <em>Tender Buttons</em>.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a> It is an exquisite little thing in cream covers, with
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
a green moon in the center, implying the yolk of an egg with which “something
is the matter,” and it gave me rare pleasure to witness the first attempt
to revolutionize the most obsolete and inflexible medium of Art—words. The
author has endeavored to use language in the same way as Kandinsky uses
his colors: to discard conventional structure, to eliminate understandable
figures and forms, and to create a “spiritual harmony,” leaving to the layman
the task of discovering the “<em>innerer Klang</em>.” Both iconoclasts have admirably
succeeded; both the “Improvisations” and the little “essays” on roast-beef
and seltzer-bottles have given me the great joy of cocreating, allowing
me to interpret them in my own autonomous way. Says the Painter:<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-2" id="fnote-2">[2]</a>
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The apt use of a word, repetition of this word, twice, three times or even more
frequently, will not only tend to intensify the inner harmony but also to bring to
light unsuspected spiritual properties of the word itself. Further than that, frequent
repetition of a word deprives the word of its original external meaning.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Gertrude Stein has beautifully followed this recipe. Words, plain everyday
words, have lost their “external meaning” under her skilful manipulation,
and in their grotesque arrangement, frequent repetition, and intentional incoherence
they have come to serve as quaint ephemeral sounds of a suggestive
symphony, or, if you please, cacophony. The <em>Tender Buttons</em> arouse in the
sympathetic reader a limitless amount of moods, from scherzo to maestoso.
I shall recall for you a few lines of one peculiar motive:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="note">

</p>

<p class="noindent">

</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Do you not feel the deep melancholy underlying these incongruities?
I could quote places that would bring you into a totally different mood, most
hilarious at times. These “exaggerated cranberries,” to paraphrase an expression
of one of my incurable colleagues, should be chanted to the music of
another great iconoclast, Schoenberg. But I observe an indulgent sneer on
your face. Of course, I am an Incurable—<em>Adieu</em>!

<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">e</span> are all soldiers now and literature, for the time, has disappeared.
The publishing business is at a standstill, reviews are cutting down their
size, and all the best poets are sedulously learning to form fours in the
squares of London. It is, by itself, a remarkable thing, which will have an
effect on all of us when the war stops and we begin to write again. To
leave your pens and paper, to know that you have before you in the day,
not an endless struggle with rhythm, rhyme, and editors, but a few hours’
drilling that is laborious and terminable—it is a rousing experience for a
poet, mentally as well as physically.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the literary result of the war is nothing but disastrous. All
our more or less “official” poets—Mr. Bridges, Mr. Newbolt, Mr. Binyon,
Mr. Watson, Mr. Phillips, and so on—have come forward with amazing
arrays of abstract nouns. Mr. Bridges, who is almost the worst as well
as almost the best of living poets, printed a copy of verses in <em>The Times</em>
which rhymed far less often than is proper in a ceremonial piece and ended
thus:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Up, careless, awake!</p>

        <p class="verse1">GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="noindent">
Mr. William Watson has been prodigal of poetry and has reached his highest
level in a poem which contains the following singular lines:—
</p>

It is a very sad business. These gentlemen have retired to their studies,
determined to feel what is proper, and they come out having done their best;
but they will be heartily ashamed of it—I hope—in a few months. Unfortunately,
Mr. John Lane has collected their verses in a volume and is selling
their shame for charity. Three good poems have come out of the welter,
one by Mr. G. K. Chesterton—<em>The Wife of Flanders</em>, a very fine composition—and
two by Mr. De La Mare.
</p>

<p>
The trouble is that a poet does not feel war fever very acutely in a
general sense. Patriotic poetry is nearly always bad. If there is a worthy
reference to the Armada in Elizabethan poetry, it has escaped me; and the
English resistance to Napoleon has never been a very happy subject for
English writers. The good poetry that is provoked by war is of a different
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
character: it is personal, visual, and concrete. It never expresses any general
aspect of war, but only such subjects as have been personally observed
and felt by the poet. I would give as instances Rudyard Kipling and the
German poet Liliencron, both of whom have written well about soldiers and
fighting, but foolishly about War and Patriotism.
</p>

<p>
Yet any poet going about the streets today must see and feel a quantity
of poetical things. A week or so ago, I saw an endless baggage-train belonging
to the artillery, as it passed through Barnet. It had come from
Worcester, commandeering horses and wagons on the way; it was going to
Brentwood and thence—God knows! It was very long and uneven—the
carts had bakers’ and butchers’ names on them—the horses were ridden
with halters and sacks for saddles—the men were tired and dishevelled. I
spoke to one of them who was watering his horse at a trough, offered to
bring him beer from a public-house close by; but someone had given him
tea farther back on the road and he would rot. He thanked me and rode
away, drooping very much over his horse’s neck. It was all a poem in
itself or it gave me the emotions of a poem, because it had none of the
conventional glitter of war. It was poetical because it was business-like,
just as our khaki service uniforms are more beautiful than the bright clothes
the troops wear in peace.
</p>

<p>
If the war-poets would confine themselves to real and tangible things
like this, they might well express the experience through which we are now
passing. But they seem unhappily obsessed with the idea of expressing an
obstreperous valour and self-confidence and bluster which the nation is very
far from feeling. The nation, so far as I can gauge it, is showing an obstinate,
workmanlike silence and does not either make light of, or grumble at,
the hardships it has to suffer: the baggage-train of which I have spoken was
a very adequate symbol of this. But no one is ever so greatly out of touch
with the people as a popular poet.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the war, the musical in London were shocked by
an announcement that no German or Austrian music would be played at the
famous Queen’s Hall Promenade Concerts. We were naturally a little
upset, as we depend on these performances for solid and regular entertainment:
and it seemed hard and unnecessary to renounce Bach, Mozart,
Beethoven, Wagner, and even Schönberg. Luckily good sense and humour
killed the absurd idea, but not before a French and Russian programme had
been substituted for the first Wagner night. Now, much as I shrink from
the thought of having to hear Tschaikowsky instead of Wagner, I do believe
that we have a cause for national resentment against the second of these
composers. His ridiculous and windy prose-works have been among the
writings which have provoked the war. With Nietzsche, and with the renegade
Englishman, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, he has encouraged the
notion that there is a special Teutonic culture which is superior to any other
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
and which deserves to be spread at any cost. Such an idea has never
appealed to the true Germans (e. g., Goethe, who knew what he owed to
France and England), but it has been useful to the Prussian soldiers, who
have debased and vulgarized true German culture. Perhaps I am exceeding
the duties of a London letter-writer and becoming an advocate; but I think
I am giving you an accurate account of the feelings of those here who
admire German poetry and music. I am not a Chauvinist in art—few people
are. I read Goethe impenitently in the public trains and trams, to the
disgust of my neighbours, and I continue to sing German songs, a little out
of tune: unless my Territorial uniform is served out to me very soon, I shall
probably be arrested as a spy.

<span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="postfirstchar">ome</span> years ago a good woman, who would like to be foster-mother
to all struggling heroes, was sitting at midnight in her down-town flat.
Suddenly there was a noise at the front door, someone leapt up the staircases
two steps at a time, and rushed into her room shouting “I’ve got it!
I’ve got it!” She turned around and saw the dark face of a young actor,
shining with excitement. He immediately burst into a superb interpretation
of a passage from <em>Hamlet</em>. He had been working over it for two weeks
without being able to satisfy himself, but it had come to him that evening.
He could not wait to let his good friend know, had jumped on an elevated
train, and after being carried two stations too far in his elation, was there
with his prize.
</p>

<p>
No, this is not the beginning of a magazine story, nor is it a passage
from the biography of a deceased European celebrity. It is the simple
truth about a young American dramatist who is known only to a few;—and
he is of New England stock!
</p>

<p>
Later the young Hamlet, having completed his acting apprenticeship,
began to write, and went into the real estate business to support himself.
Nobody wanted his plays; they were too “highbrow.” So he began to build
a theatre of his own. The managers’ trust put every difficulty in his way,
and finally, when the building was nearly done and the company was
engaged, succeeded in crushing him. The next attempt was a repertory
company on the East side, but this wiped out what little was left of his
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
resources before it got fairly started. One play was produced on Broadway;—it
ran two weeks. Last year another was rehearsed for nine weeks,
but it was withdrawn on the day of the dress rehearsal, because the author
refused to make a change insisted on by the manager. Now the writer has
retired to his farm in the Connecticut hills, where he and a companion
have with their own hands built a little theatre. In this, on Sunday afternoons
during the summer, he reads from his fifteen manuscript plays to
such few people as can get there to hear him. And as he reads, there is
on his face much the same enthusiasm as on the night years ago when he
got his passage from <em>Hamlet</em>.
</p>

<p>
I visited Butler Davenport for the third time last Sunday. The main
house is a rambling mid-Victorian affair, with queer crannies and cupola
rooms from which one can look far across the hills to the Sound. On its
left is an old farmhouse of the eighteenth century, furnished as Mr. Butler’s
grandfather left it, and with a musty smell which no old-furniture shop
could counterfeit. Between the two is an old-fashioned garden, in midsummer
filled with larkspur, cosmos, and a hundred other flowers which
few but our grandmothers could name. At the intersection of walks at its
center is a crab-apple tree, surrounded by a bench. A formal garden with
high, thick cedar hedges, bird-houses, unsuspected grass walks and an avenue
of woodbine arches lies on the other side of the main house. In the
rear, stretching out towards the wide valley, is a long, hedged walk ending
in an arch, between fields of wild flowers. Down it one could go to any
kind of distant mystery.
</p>

<p>
The theatre is a simple, strong little building behind the old farmhouse.
Its most expert bit of carpentry is the balcony, but that is, of course, unpretentious.
The seats are ordinary kitchen chairs, and there is nothing on the
stage but a reading desk. But the luxury of sitting between wide-open
doors in the hill-breeze, full of grass odors and wing sounds, is better than
the comfort of plush seats and much gilded fresco.
</p>

<p>
This time, however, as there were only four of us, we sat out under
an apple tree. Except for a moment when a tragic passage was interrupted
to shoo away a loud-voiced and ill-mannered hen, it was the most nearly
perfect theatre I have known.
</p>

<p>
And the play? It is impossible to do more than hint at the nature of
unpublished plays. This one dealt with the “white slave” question, but in
a way infinitely superior to the melodrama of <em>The Lure</em> or <em>The Fight</em>. There
was another, of subtler treatment, called <em>Deferred Payment</em>, showing the
natural retribution seeking out a man who looked for everything in a woman
except companionship. <em>Keeping Up Appearances</em>—the one actually produced—pictures
a middle-class family engaged in a tragic struggle with the
pocket book on account of the false ideals of the community. <em>Justice</em>,
written before Galsworthy’s play of the same name, draws a parallel between
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
society’s persecution of a woman who is consecrated to a fine love without
marriage, and society’s punishment of the unfortunate victims of prostitution.
Mr. Davenport’s best work is in <em>The Importance of Coming and
Going</em>, a satirical tragi-comedy which contrasts the exaggerated emphasis
we lay on death with the casual way we regard birth. When a person who
never should have come into the world leaves it, perhaps gladly, we weep
copiously and buy showy funerals; but mothers let their daughters marry
any kind of man of wealth or position, without giving them any insight into
the mysteries of birth.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Davenport’s plays do not rank with Ibsen’s or even with Galsworthy’s.
But thousands of worse plays have been produced and have succeeded—simply
because they contained no ideas. Mr. Davenport is master
of a technique which would make it easy for him to write a popular success
if he did not insist on saying something. One manager has told him that
he is ten years ahead of his time, but that if he were only European his work
could be produced. A publisher wrote him that his plays could be issued
in book form if he were only well-known. Mr. Davenport’s question, “My
dear Mr. ——, how am I to become well known?” has not elicited a reply.
</p>

<p>
This man’s spirit will remain just as eager and strong as when he
began; he may get before the public eventually. Even this year hopeful
new plans are under way. But whether he ever succeeds or not, he will have
found in life a thousand times more than the obtuse millions who are deaf
to him. It would be an insult to offer him sympathy.
</p>

<p>
And it would be stupid to place final blame on the managers or the
publishers, or to think that such things as drama leagues can furnish a
fundamental remedy for the apathy of the public. The whole structure
of society must be altered, and the quality of the individual human spirit
must be quickened, before our leaders can find any adequate reaction in
the crowds. We have denied ourselves the artistic stimulus of a cohesive
aristocracy. How shall we vitalize our democracy?

Forbes-Robertson’s Hamlet
</h3>

<p class="note">
(<em>Blackstone Theatre</em>)
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">ne</span> of the noblest things I have ever seen on the stage—or ever expect
to see—is the Hamlet of Forbes-Robertson. The poet, the scholar, the
philosopher, the great gentleman, the lover, the brilliant talker, the anguished
boy—they are all there in the tall man in black with the graven face
and the wonderful hands and the voice of surpassing richnesses—the tall,
graceful, impetuous, humorous, agonized man in black who reads Shakespeare
as if he were improvising and makes a true and charming human
being out of a character that has had the misfortune to become a problem.
“And please observe,” writes Bernard Shaw, “that this is not a cold Hamlet.
He is none of your logicians who reason their way through the world because
they cannot feel their way through it; his intellect is the organ of his
passion; his eternal self-criticism is as alive and thrilling as it can possibly
be.” His moment of expiation, alone at the back of the stage, with his
arms raised to the vaulted heavens; and his gallant last moment on the
throne with its single silver sentence, “The rest is silence”—these things
are too moving to be articulate about. Richard Le Gallienne has expressed
it all as well as it can be done: “All my life I seem to have been asking my
friends, those I loved best, those who valued the dearest, the kindest, the
greatest, and the strongest, in our strange human life, to come with me and
see Forbes-Robertson die in <em>Hamlet</em>. I asked them because, as that strange
young dead king sat upon his throne, there was something, whatever it
meant—death, life, immortality, what you will—of a surpassing loneliness,
something transfiguring the poor passing moment of trivial, brutal murder
into a beauty to which it was quite natural that that stern Northern warrior,
with his winged helmet, should bend the knee. I would not exchange anything
I have ever read or seen for Forbes-Robertson as he sits there so still
and starlit upon the throne of Denmark.”

“The Yellow Ticket”
</h3>

<p class="note">
(<em>Powers’ Theatre</em>)
</p>

<p class="noindent">
A bleeding chunk of reality is not art, but it is a bleeding chunk of reality;
your aesthetic emotions may sleep at the sight of a tortured animal, but
your humane emotions will roll up to your throat when you witness the
simple tragedy of a Jewish girl in St. Petersburg, presented in Michael Morton’s
play, <em>The Yellow Ticket</em>. To me such a realistic play in such a realistic
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
presentation has as little to do with dramatic art as a reporter’s story has to
do with literature; but I brushed aside my memories of Rheinhardt and
Komissarzhevskaya when I went to see a piece of Russian life at Powers’.
And I saw it indeed—real, nude, appalling.
</p>

<p>
Some of my acquaintances have asked me whether the tragedy could
be true, whether a Jewish girl has no right to live in St. Petersburg, unless
she has bought her protection from the police by selling her reputation—that
is by procuring a yellow ticket, the trade-licence of a prostitute. Yes, it
is true. A Jew is forbidden to abide outside the Pale of Settlement, with
the exception of certain merchants and persons of a university education,
and prostitutes. The latter form the most desirable element in the eyes of
government officials, since their occupation does not generally presuppose
any predilections for revolutionary ideas or free thought. I have known
instances where women involved in the Revolution, gentiles as well as Jewesses,
obtained yellow tickets which served them the rôle of a <em>carte blanche</em>
from the molestations of the police. There are many anecdotic facts in
Russian life that seem incredible to the outsider, and Mr. Morton has produced
in his play a mass of such facts with photographic verisimilitude.
It must be said to the credit of the actors that they have escaped the slippery
path of melodramatic overdoing.

<p class="noindent">
“Hosanna!” I felt like shouting, when the curtains slowly concealed
the mysterious stage. I am still under the spell of the oriental atmosphere,
not yet cooled off for objective criticism. What Florence Kiper Frank has
done with the biblical subject may terrify the orthodox student of the Bible,
but I greeted her daring heresy and free manipulation of epochs and styles.
She has skilfully blended the bloodthirsty, gloating outcries of Deborah’s
Song with the idyllic lyrics of Solomon’s Songs, and has presented in <em>Jael</em> a
composite type, a mixture of the savage tent-woman, of the passionate yet
gentle Shulamite, and of the eternal jealous female. The result, as far
as the creation of an atmosphere goes, is a positive success.
</p>

<p>
A word about the staging. Maurice Browne, on the privilege of a pioneer,
may be congratulated on the progress he has made in leaving behind
mouldy conventions and approaching the state where he can produce pure
aesthetic emotions. The three one-act plays on the present bill, regardless
of their merits or demerits, demonstrate the great possibilities of an artistic
stage manager, who can do away with elaborate accessories and produce
suggestive illusions with the aid of an ultramarine background and calico
apple blossoms. Yet, as in all pioneering, there are signs of hesitation and of
half-measures. I am sure that the effect of <em>Jael</em> would not in the least
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
diminish (it would rather be intensified), if we were spared the inevitable
storm-pyrotechnics. The verses in themselves imply the idea of battle and
tempest, and Miss Kiper in the title rôle has the voice and diction to serve
the purpose.

Harold Bauer in Chicago

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> yet remain certain pianists and other opinionated craftsmen
in music who will say, when approached on the subject of Harold
Bauer’s piano playing: “Oh, yes; but you know Bauer is—well, shall
we say?—a monotonist. His playing is all of one style—beautiful tone,
to be sure; but, oh, such a sameness! He shades beautifully—yes, surely,
but it’s all too colorless.” And it probably never occurs to these critics
that a pianist who uses an entirely beautiful tone, who shades delicately,
and who is definitely individual in his playing, might not seem monotonous
to the admirers of true piano-artistry. And it is quite certain that
these carpers failed to attend Bauer’s last Sunday afternoon recital in
Orchestra Hall, when and where the above composite quotation was
put to shame.
</p>

<p>
The program was headed by that most unequal set of little pieces—interesting,
dull, graceful, and often clumsy:—Brahm’s Waltzes. The
Brahms faddists may sacrifice all the credit to their idol, but he deserves
only a part of it; for Bauer made these waltzes float as lightly
and pleasantly as the material permitted, and invested them with all possible
contrast and pulse. There was no lack of what pianists call “point,”
either in this opening number or in the remainder of the program; and
it is this quality of “point,” which is the season more in evidence in
Bauer’s work than ever before, which makes the carpers appear rather
uninformed. “Point” is nothing mysterious; it means definite and crisp
rhythm, brightness of tone designed to contrast with richness and
warmth of tone, sharp shadings artistically brought out, and a deeply
satisfying precision in tempi. This man’s work deserves this inclusive
term. Whatever lack there might have been in seasons past (there has
been a fragile foundation for the criticism mentioned at the beginning
of this appreciation, when, as late as three years ago, his tonal ideals apparently
did not include great brilliance), this Sunday recital went far to
establish the fact that Bauer has a happy variety of tone-colors at his
command, which variety includes no little brilliance. Sheer facility and
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
digital expertness have never seemed to occupy the attention of this
master-pianist, except insofar as such facility and expertness would give
expression to purely musical content; and now if the carpers continue
to shrug their shoulders at the praise of Bauer, it will be because they
miss the usual bombast and key-swatting of esteemed mediocrity, and
certainly not because of any inadequacy of technic for musical purposes,
or lack of pianistic lustre. No mediocrity of a technic-worshipper or
piano-eater ever gave a performance of Beethoven’s Opus 3 that could
compare with that of Bauer on Sunday afternoon; for he then projected
a deeply significant art, particularly in the first movement of the sonata,
which must be inexplicable in words. Schumann’s <em>Scenes from Childhood</em>
were given a highly imaginative treatment—a treatment which penetrated
even the academics. And Schumann’s Toccata—that battered
veteran of many an ivory struggle—ceased for once to be an endurance
stunt, and hummed forth (as the composer hoped and indicated) as a
strangely beautiful bit of music. Bauer’s playing of this will remain
long in the awakened music-receptacles. So will his interpretation of
his own arrangement of César Franck’s Prelude, Choral, and Fugue—which
are three movements vieing with each other for supreme religious
solidity—and his nonchalant handling of the tricky D-flat Study of Liszt.
The Chopin Scherzo in C-sharp minor closed a program which would
surely have been sombre and sleepy under the fingers of any less than
a pianistic musician. In certain splendid moments Bauer seems like a
high priest performing a tonal miracle, or like a potent magician weaving
curious and impossible dream-fabrics. And, with all pleasant fancies
put aside, he is an exponent of modern pianism at its best.

Children are born materialists, poets, and joy-worshippers. We tame
them and they grow up philistines, supernaturalists, and respectable believers
in the disinterested love of dullness. Instead of teaching them
theories and superstitions, we should tell them that they are parts of the
universe; that the carbon, iron, sulphur, phosphorus, oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen, the zero-gases, and the dozen other elements of which our bodies
are made are also the main elements of sun, moon, and stars,—of the whole
material universe. The next step might be to show the child, through
actual experiments, the known physical and chemical properties of these
elements, thus preparing its mind for the greatest of all poetries—the poetry
of evolution. These things need but be shown, not laboriously learned by
rote; they need only to be told, not to be taught; and if the child’s healthy
inquisitiveness has not been ruined by repression, it will delight in feeling
the pull of the magnet; in watching the electric spark that unites oxygen and
hydrogen into water; in drawing the marvelous beauties of snow flakes and
other crystal formations; in watching and aiding the growth of birds,
beasts, flowers, or fruits; in the thrill of blended voices or in other forms
of voluntary co-operation. All these things, all the realities need but be
shown to delight the untainted mind of childhood; while daily free association
with other children will soon give to each child a practical working
knowledge of ethics (quite impossible to attain under the boss-system of
the government schoolmistress) from which, as a basis, the errors of our
economic and social systems can be pointed out and discussed. In the minds
and hearts of these free children, ideals can then be formulated which will
tend toward their development into the free society of the future, whose coming
their own efforts will hasten. For it is only through the successive enslavement
of each succeeding generation that governments can retain their
powers.

<span class="firstchar">F</span><span class="postfirstchar">ull</span> of visions and ideals and eager to express them in their own way,
a group of striving young painters and sculptors in this city is working industriously
without regard for applause from either the crowd or the few.
Just as there are religious and social rebels—people who refuse to accept the
old dogmas and habits merely because they were successful at a certain time
and fit for a certain period in human history—these young artists refuse to
adopt methods and views of the past for the purpose of expressing their
views on modern subjects.
</p>

<p>
In striving to realize the new idea in form and color they are of necessity
passing through that period in which the intellect discerns and style is
chosen—the period of experiment. And if they do not achieve as great a
success as the old masters, they certainly work in the spirit of a Monet or a
Rembrandt. We print this month reproductions of work done by four of
these artists. They have nothing in common except that they are all trying
to express themselves in their own way.
</p>

<p>
Jerome S. Blum, the oldest and best known of the group, is an extraordinary
painter of the usual. He does not rely on a dramatic subject, or on
a sensational technic, to arouse interest in his work. It is his unusual way
of looking at people and nature, and his vigorous and interesting color
schemes, that have made his paintings notable. Mr. Blum is far too imaginative
to be natural, far too poetic to be “real.” All his work strikes one as
a spontaneous expression of almost childish delight in color.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Orator</em> is the work of Stanislaw Szukalski, a boy of nineteen, who
comes from Russian Poland. He studied at the Krakau Academy, where
he received two gold medals and five other prizes. On entering his studio
your amazement grows as you wander from one thought or emotion to
another in plaster. Each one grips and holds you vigorously. <em>Impressions
of Praying</em>, <em>Sleeping</em>, <em>Hurling</em>, and <em>Bondage</em>, a few very interesting portraits
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
of Max Krammer and Professor Chiio, and also a full figure of Victor
Hugo tell of the spiritual insight of this young sculptor—the unexpected
in every one. His works are full of life and imagination. The fact
that some of our able nonentities have characterized them as caricatures
proves how narrow-minded some of our sculptors are today.
</p>

<p>
C. Raymond Johnson is only twenty-three years old, and in all the work
he has done so far purity, brilliance of color and spaciousness predominate.
It is the suggestion in his present work of great possibilities in the
near future that makes them interesting. The one in this issue shows the
highly decorative effects of his ideas. Besides painting Mr. Johnson finds
time to experiment with colored lighting and the making of most original
posters for the Chicago Little Theatre.
</p>

<p>
Christian Abrahamsen, the young and independent portrait painter, has
done some very remarkable work. His portraits are the result of penetrating
study of his subject and adaptation on the part of the painter to the
moods of the sitter. He varies his style with his subject. His portrait of
Michael Murphy sparkles with life and vigor and holds your attention as
few of the portraits of older painters can. Beside portraits Mr. Abrahamsen
paints sunny landscapes in the open air and under clear skies. The large
canvas filled with the freshness, strength, and beauty of a clearing in northern
Wisconsin, reproduced in this issue of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, represents
some of the work done last summer.

Vachel Lindsay’s Books
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Congo and Other Poems</em>, by Vachel Lindsay. [The Macmillan Company,
New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> is not too much to say that many of us are watching Vachel Lindsay
with the undisguised hope in our hearts that he may yet prove to be the
“Great American Poet.” He has come so fast and far on the road to art
and sanity since the early days when he drew minute, and seemingly pathological,
maps of the territories of heaven, and grinning grotesques of the
Demon Rum! He has carved his own way with so huge and careless a hand!
And his work, in spite of its strangeness, is so deeply rooted in the crude but
stirring consciousness that is America to-day! Surely there is ground for
hope.
</p>

<p>
Like every artist who creates a new form, Mr. Lindsay has had to
educate his public. And the task is not by any means accomplished yet. We
have had to overcome an instinctive feeling that poetry should be dignified,
and to look the fact in the face that it must first of all be telling, and that
in cases where these two elements conflict, dignity is a secondary consideration.
We have been rudely jostled out of our academic position that poetry
must be condensed, poignant, and literary, and we have been shown that by
going back to the primitive conception—which included as the principal element
the half-chant of the bard—true poetry may be diffuse, full of endless
iterations and strangely impassioned over crude and even external objects.
So much we have learned, and after the first shock of surprise, learned gladly.
It has opened to us whole new reaches of enjoyment. We hope sincerely
that we are not yet done with Mr. Lindsay’s educative process.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Congo</em> is the title poem of his new volume. To describe the poem
adequately would require almost as much space as the nine pages it occupies.
So it must suffice to say that it is perilously near great poetry, broad in
sweep, imaginative, full of fire and color, psychological—and very strange.
Much in the same vein are <em>The Firemen’s Ball</em> and <em>The Santa Fe Trail</em>,
which appeared originally in <em>Poetry</em>.
</p>

<p>
Several of the poems in this volume, among them <em>Darling Daughter of
Babylon</em> and <em>I Went Down Into the Desert</em>, are already familiar to readers
of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, as they were first published in the June number.
The volume contains also a delightful section of poems for children, and a
group dealing with the present European war.
</p>

<p>
Both <em>The Congo</em> and Mr. Lindsay’s earlier volume, <em>General Booth
Enters Heaven</em>, are extraordinarily interesting books. Every mind which is
truly alive to-day should know at least one of them.

[Mitchell Kennerley, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Almost simultaneously with <em>The Congo</em> has appeared a prose volume
by Mr. Lindsay, <em>Adventures while Preaching the Gospel of Beauty</em>. It is an
account, in the form of a diary, of a walk through Missouri and Kansas,
and into Colorado. Its value is almost purely personal. To anyone who is
interested in Mr. Lindsay’s striking personality, this book will serve as a
spiritual Baedeker. As literature its value is comparatively slight. It contains,
however, one of his most striking poems, <em>The Kallyope Yell</em>, which
appeared originally in <em>The Forum</em>. This alone is worth the price of the
volume.

<p class="book">
<em>The Man of Genius</em>, by Herman Tuerck. [The Macmillan Company, New
York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Professor Tuerck, a very normal German, has been writing critical
essays since the end of the eighties, and he has not changed a bit—the same
good old idealist of the sissy category. In this book he makes a study of
Genius, and comes to the magnificent conclusion that the chief characteristics
of a genius must be goodliness, loving kindness, respect, and loyalty to existing
institutions, obedience to the law, objectivity, and truth. Naturally, those
who do not possess these delicacies are villains. The professor demonstrates
two groups of thinkers, one in angelic white, the other in devilish black.
Among the first, the real geniuses, we find beside Christ, Buddha, Shakespeare,
Goethe, Byron, also Alexander, Cæsar, and Napoleon. But oh, Mr.
Wilson, what German atrocities! Mr. Tuerck mercilessly disfigures his
victims and pastes upon them with his saliva accurate, uniform labels. In
<em>Hamlet</em>, in <em>Faust</em>, in <em>Manfred</em>, in the mentioned law-givers and warriors,
the author manages to discover goody-goody traits of exemplary burghers.
In the Black Gallery we face the lugubrious sinners—Stirner, Nietzsche,
and Ibsen. “Woe to him who follows these modern antisophers!” cries
Mr. Tuerck, for they are enemies of humanity, of the state, of society, of
reality, of truth, for they are selfish and subjective. “The Devil, the Father
of Lies, is great and Friedrich Nietzsche is his prophet.”
</p>

<p>
A word of reassurance for Mr. Thomas Hardy. This Sauerkraut-gem,
<em>The Man of Genius</em>, has had <em>seven</em> editions in Germany, and has aroused
wide enthusiasm there, as witnessed by the numerous press-notices exaltingly
praising the great idealist Tuerck, written by professors, Geheimraths,
Hofraths, catholics, protestants, and even by socialists! Now, pray, ought
there be any fear for the Nietzscheanization of the Fatherland?

Kilmer’s Confession
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Trees, and Other Poems</em>, by Joyce Kilmer. [George H. Doran Company,
New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Mr. Kilmer furnishes the following prose account of his convictions:
“I am catholic in my tastes and Catholic in religion, am socially a democrat
and politically a Democrat. I am a special writer on the staff of the <em>New
York Times Sunday Magazine</em>, the <em>Times Review of Books</em> and the <em>Literary
Digest</em>. I am bored by Feminism, Futurism, Free Love.” This is perhaps
a more succinct expression of his facility of faith than can be found in his
verse. Readers should thank him for it, because it renders unnecessary any
further attempt to discover what he believes.
</p>

<p>
At the opening of the volume, Mr. Kilmer quotes the following stanza
from Coventry Patmore:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Mine is no horse with wings, to gain</p>
          <p class="verse2">The region of the Spheral chime</p>
      <p class="verse">He does but drag a rumbling wain,</p>
          <p class="verse2">Cheered by the coupled bells of rhyme.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
This, too, is useful, because it frankly warns us against looking in his
verse for anything which is not there.
</p>

<p>
Within his self-imposed limitations, Mr. Kilmer has done good work.
The amusing couplets about <em>Servant Girl and Grocer’s Boy</em> have pleased
countless newspaper readers, <em>The Twelve-Forty-Five</em> is a graphic description
of the feeling produced by a late suburban train, <em>To a Young Poet Who
Killed Himself</em> is an obvious rebuke to the small-hearted versifier, and <em>Old
Poets</em> is a comfortable exposition of the philosophy of comfort. The religious
poems will probably not be moving to anyone who does not share Mr. Kilmer’s
creed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kilmer’s work is glossy with a simplicity more easy-going than
profound. Though he is young himself, he obviously does not sympathize
with young poets, of whom he writes:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">There is no peace to be taken</p>
          <p class="verse2">With poets who are young,</p>
      <p class="verse">For they worry about the wars to be fought</p>
          <p class="verse2">And the songs that must be sung.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
His ideal is that of the “old poet”:—
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">But the old man knows that he’s in his chair</p>
          <p class="verse2">And that God’s on His throne in the sky.</p>
      <p class="verse">So he sits by his fire in comfort</p>
          <p class="verse2">And he lets the world spin by.</p>

Hilarious Iconoclasm
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Art</em>, by Clive Bell. [Frederick A. Stokes Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It is an exquisite pleasure to disagree with Clive Bell! Like a fierce Hun
he whirls through the art galleries of Europe, and smashes all venerated
masterpieces into a heap of rubbish, sparing but the Byzantine Primitives
and some of the Post-Impressionists. Between these two epochs he sees a
hideous gap; not more than one in a hundred of the works produced
between 1450 and 1850 is he willing to accept as a work of art. It naturally
hurts to witness the slaughter of your old friends, such as Michelangelo,
Velasquez, Whistler; but our Attila performs his massacre so beautifully,
with such a charming sense of humor, that you cannot help admiring the
paradoxical feats. What but a good-<a id="corr-28"></a>humored smile will provoke in you
such a prank, e. g.: “Nietzsche’s preposterous nonsense knocked the bottom
out of nonsense more preposterous and far more vile”? The best part of it
is the fact that the author does not attempt to convince you in anything, for
neither is he convinced in the infallibility of his hypotheses. The book is a
relucent gem among the recent dull and heavy works of art.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="COMMENTS_OF_AN_IDLER_ON_THREE_NEW_BOOKS">
Comments of an Idler on Three New Books
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
<em>Eris: A Dramatic Allegory</em>, by Blanche Shoemaker Wagstaff (Moffatt,
Yard), is, we are told on the cover, “full of vigorous enthusiasm, and
embodies the philosophy of Henri Bergson,” to whom on a flyleaf the book
is duly dedicated. It is in careful rhythmic blank verse; a dialogue, principally,
between “Man” and “Thought,” with “Past” and “Future” now
and then interrupting. The allegory is prefaced by a portrait of the author
by Helleu; we trust an unfair one. A strangely bovine expression greets us
from under a <a id="corr-29"></a>plumed black hat and from over shoulders and arms drawn
like a Goops. <a id="corr-30"></a>Helleu made lovely things once; why this?
</p>

<p>
In <em>Eris</em> we find Man hurling defiance at Thought, who taunts him,
“You cannot vanquish me while Life endures.” Discussion between them
on this point covers some forty pages of melodious argument. Six of these
(and they are consecutive) form a fairly comprehensive guide-book to a
trip around the world, as Man, distracted, stops off at many well-known
points seeking to escape pursuing Thought.
</p>

desperately:

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
They struggle together, and Man plunges over the cliff. Thought, “assuming
a sudden intenser magnitude, rises out of the dust of Man” (the stage
directions seem a little confused here) and <a id="corr-31"></a>shouts:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
There are graceful lines and pictures, occasionally a good simile.
Technically the lines are too smooth, too neatly finished, each in its little
five-iambic jacket. The lyrics lack singing quality. There is a tedious
list, two pages, of famous ladies—Helen, Sappho, Salammbo, from Eve to
the Virgin Mary—as Man cries to Past, “What woman are you in disguise?”
Swinburne did this gorgeously somewhere, making each speak; but these
do not—they do not even live.
</p>

<p>
Totally different is my second volume of verse—<em>The Sea is Kind</em>, by
T. Sturge Moore (Houghton Mifflin). A letter from the publishers suggests
that “like Noyes and Masefield, T. Sturge Moore may have a message
to American lovers of poetry.” I am an American lover of poetry and an
eager one; therefore, I was hopeful; but I am oppressed by the obligation
of doing justice to the initial poem in the book, viz.: <em>The Sea is Kind</em>, because
I cannot tell at all what it is about. Several people, by name Evarne
and Plexaura, females, and Menaleas and Eucritos, males, seem to be talking
high talk by the edge of the sea—about ships and storms and nymphs
and kindred things. Evarne speaks at great length in rough pentameters,
quoting others more obscure, if possible, than herself.

In <em>Judith</em>, one of the group to Moore, a vigorous note is sounded.
This is good, and maybe the rest is too; I do not know. It rolls above my
head.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Spirit of Life</em>, a series of nine essays by Mowry Saben (Mitchell
Kennerley), is the kind of book that makes me savagely controversial and
then cross for heeding it at all. Its platitudinous optimism meanders along
through some two hundred and fifty pages under various chapter headings:
Nature, Morals, Sex, Heroes, etc. The first sentence is: “There are many
great Truths that can be expressed only by means of paradox”; and the last,
“If life means nothing, if the universe means nothing, then reform is only
an illusory word, which has come to confuse us upon the highway of
Despair; but if in our highest ideals we may find the real meaning of our
personal lines, because they are the quintessence of the spiritual universe,
whose avatars we should be, there is nothing too glorious for the heart of
man to conceive.” All in between is just like that.
</p>

<p>
All persons, and there are many, who are determined willy nilly to
believe the world a nice place; who, confronted with the unlovely, the stark,
gaping and horrid, cast down their eyes exclaiming “It is not there,” will
take solid comfort in <em>The Spirit of Life</em>. It is like the millions of sermons
droned out one day in seven all over the land to patient folk who no longer
know why they come nor why they stay to hear.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-64" class="pagenum" title="64"></a>
But this is a review, not a diatribe—so “consider now” the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
The first essay is called <em>Nature</em>. It quotes freely from Peter Bell, and
also reprints something about tongues in trees and sermons in stones. Turning
the leaves we catch the names of Burroughs, Whitman, and Thoreau.
Toward the end is this:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Everything exists for him who is great enough to envisage it. The life that now
is reveals man as the crowning glory of Nature, the goal of evolution. In the end
the earth does but shelter our bones, not our thoughts and aspirations.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Skipping the rest, we turn quickly to <em>Sex</em>, hoping something from the
vitality of the theme, and come to this:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
To attack Sex as one of the joys of life would be foolish and deservedly
futile.... I am certain that sex is a sweetener of the cup of life, but one
must not therefore infer that there can never be too much sweetening, for there
can be, even to the point of danger from spiritual diabetes.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Immortal phrase, “Spiritual diabetes.” Several pages of this essay are
devoted to episodes in the life of insects, all pointing a painful lesson to
man:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
... and there are spiders doomed to be eaten by the female as soon as they
have demonstrated their masculinity. Thus are we taught how little permanence
is possessed by an organization which yields only the instinct of passionate desire
for sex.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Here is boldness,—
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
I cannot indorse the ascetic ideal that holds the love of man for woman to be
but a snare for the spirit. The great poetry of Dante alone is sufficient to refute so
baseless a claim.

Why quote further? There are indubitably certain good things in the
book, but they are by Goethe, Carlyle, Emerson, Dante, Shakespeare, Whitman,
et al.

<em>Modern English Literature</em>: From Chaucer to the Present Day, by G. H. Mair.
[Henry Holt and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Good histories of English literature are rare, and Mr. Mair’s book
should accordingly be given a warm welcome, for it combines brevity with
comprehensiveness of treatment in a very unusual manner. Mr. Mair not
only writes well and knows his subject, but he seems instinctively to know
what his readers will want—and he supplies it.
</p>

<p>
For instance, we do not remember that popular histories of English
literature bother to tell such a detail as how the chronological order of
Shakespeare’s plays is determined, but Mr. Mair’s telling of that will show
<a id="page-65" class="pagenum" title="65"></a>
the layman just what literary scholarship means, and in conjunction with
his other remarks on our knowledge of Shakespeare it will rescue the uninformed
from the chance of falling into such errors as the Baconian theory.
</p>

<p>
The book, however, is not one of higher and textual criticism and chronology.
It is a work of appreciation, and the appreciation is that of a
modern man. It is obvious that Chaucer might be treated in a manner
quite alien to the interests of the man of today who is not a scholar, but
the treatment of his work which ends in joining his hands to those of
Charles Dickens as workers in a kindred quest is one that is well calculated
to persuade even the philistine that Chaucer is a figure of passable interest
to him.
</p>

<p>
It is the mark of the live man to recognize genius, and the manner
in which Mr. Mair treats the genius of that great poet, John Donne, is
in vivid contrast to the way in which it is usually treated in histories of
English literature. For example:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Very different ... is the closely packed style of Donne, who, Milton apart,
is the greatest English writer of the century, though his obscurity has kept him out
of general reading. No poetry in English, not even Browning’s, is more difficult to
understand. The obscurity of Donne and Browning proceed from such similar causes
that they are worth examining together. In both, as in the obscure passages in
Shakespeare’s later plays, obscurity arises not because the poet says too little, but
because he attempts to say too much. He huddles a new thought on the one before
it, before the first has had time to express itself; he sees things or analyzes emotions
so swiftly and subtly himself that he forgets the slower comprehension of his readers;
he is for analyzing things far deeper than the ordinary mind commonly can. His
wide and curious knowledge finds terms and likenesses to express his meaning unknown
to us; he sees things from a dozen points of view at once and tumbles a hint
of each separate vision in a heap out on to the page; his restless intellect finds new
and subtler shades of emotion and thought invisible to other pairs of eyes, and cannot,
because speech is modeled on the average of our intelligences, find words to
express them; he is always trembling on the brink of the inarticulate. All this applies
to both Donne and Browning, and the comparison could be pushed farther still. Both
draw the knowledge which is the main cause of their obscurity from the bypaths of
mediævalism. Browning’s <em>Sordello</em> is obscure because he knows too much about
mediæval Italian history: Donne’s <em>Anniversary</em> because he is too deeply read in
mediæval scholasticism and speculation. Both make themselves more difficult to the
reader who is familiar with the poetry of their contemporaries by the disconcerting
freshness of their point of view. Seventeenth-century love poetry was idyllic and
idealist; Donne’s is passionate and realistic to the point of cynicism. To read him
after reading Browne and Johnson is to have the same shock as reading Browning
after Tennyson. Both poets are salutary in the strong and biting antidote they bring
to sentimentalism in thought and melodious facility in writing. They are corrective of
lazy thinking and lazy composition.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Another feature in which this book differs from others of its kind is
that the author is not afraid to bring the record down to the work of his
contemporaries, and the struggles of Mr. Shaw with the bourgeois world,
and the era opened by M. J. Synge and the Irish literary renascence, are
here sympathetically dealt with.

Overemphasized Purity
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Love’s Legend</em>, by Fielding Hall. [Henry Holt and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
With a somewhat overemphasized regard for purity, Fielding Hall
approaches the narration of this honeymoon trip down a Burmese river.
The novel—if such a dissertation on the early marriage state could be called
a novel—is told in rather peculiar fashion, by the man and woman alternately,
at first, and later on with the help of two more people.
</p>

<p>
The man is prone to burst forth into fairy tales to explain every point
of argument to Lesbia. He tells her of a beautiful princess who was blindfolded
and kept within an enclosed garden that she might never know the
ways of man.
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
“They told her that the bandage made her see more clearly than if her eyes were
free. For they had painted images upon the inside of her bandage and told her they
were real.”
</p>

<p>
Silence.
</p>

<p>
“And she believed it. Then came a Prince. He wooed the Princess and he
won her. So he took her with him out of her garden. They came into the world
and passed into a forest. There they were quite alone.
</p>

<p>
“Take off your bandage,” said the Prince. “Look at the world and me.”
</p>

<p>
“I am afraid,” she sighed; “the world is evil.”
</p>

<p>
“It is God’s world,” the Prince replied. “He lives in it.”
</p>

<p>
“They told me that God lived in Heaven, far off, not here,” she answered.
</p>

<p>
“They told you wrong; open and you will see.”
</p>

<p>
“I will not look,” she said, “I fear the devil.”
</p>

<p>
“Your beauty is all cold,” he said, “your heart beats not!”
</p>

<p>
“What is a heart?” she asked.
</p>

<p>
“That which gives life,” he answered; “my heart beats strongly and it longs for
an answer. You have a heart as strong maybe as mine. But it is sealed. Will you
not let me loose it?”
</p>

<p>
“I am afraid,” she answered.
</p>

<p>
“Then I will tell you what he did. He held the Princess in his arms all despite
herself and tore the bandage from her eyes.”
</p>

<p>
... “Did she let him do it?”
</p>

<p>
“She heard his voice and all despite herself she let him do his will.”
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Mr. Hall voices these inanities with the appalling conceit of one who
rushes in where even the best of writers tread with circumspection. And
the worst of it is, that his rash feet have carried him nowhere, except, perhaps,
into a limelight that is likely to prove embarrassing.

<em>Russia: The Country of Extremes</em>, by N. Jarintzoff. [Henry Holt
&amp; Co., New York.] A mosaic of essays on various aspects of Russian life,
some of them of tremendous interest. Of particular importance are the chapters
on “Studentchestvo” and on “Agents Provocateurs,” which deal with the
political movements of the country. Although the book lacks unity, the
English reader will find in it a wealth of information and a helpful interpretation
of Russian misty reality. Reproductions from several great Russian
paintings are excellent.

<p>
<em>New Songs of Zion</em>; a Zionist Anthology, edited by S. Roth, New
York. If this anthology was intended to serve as an echo of the Zionist
movement, it will appear as a <em>testimonia pauperitatis</em>. The lofty ideal of
forming a cultural center in Palestine for the Wandering Jew is very pallidly
reflected in the naive verses of American boys and girls. Israel Zangwill
is also represented with a few shallow effusions to the astonishment of
those who admire his sense of humor. The translations from <em>Byalik</em> are
tolerable, and I heartily recommend the English reader to get acquainted
through them with one of the greatest living poets who is known only to
readers of Hebrew.

<p>
<em>The Two Great Art Epochs</em>, by Emma Louise Parry. [A. C. McClurg

there is still need for such text-books. The wretchedness of the reproductions
is irritating.
</p>

<p>
<em>Changing Russia</em>, by Stephen Graham. [John Lane Company, New
York.] Sentimental observations of a poetic tramp who bewails the inevitable
transformation of patriarchal, agricultural Russia into a capitalistic
state. Excellent descriptions of the picturesque shore of the Black Sea;
interesting, though often erroneous, notes on the “Intelligentzia.” Mr. Graham
has been religiously tramping the globe for many years, and his love
for nature and primitive life is manifest in every book of his.

<em>Hebrew and Babylonian Traditions</em>, by Morris Jastron. [Charles Scribner’s

<em>The Rise of the Working Class</em>, by Algernon Sidney Crapsey. [The

Many things are cited as working class gains and benefits which that class

mountebank, Lloyd George, in which he is hailed as a social and economic

<p>
<em>American Labor Unions</em>, by a Member. By Helen Marot. [Henry
Holt &amp; Company, New York.] The first book on the American labor movement
which takes tolerant and detailed notice of its later developments. The
new Syndicalist tendency in the American Federation of Labor and the
rise and growth of the Industrial Workers of the World are both discussed,
as are also the much disputed questions of political action, violence,
and sabotage. A book that merits the study of those who believe there is no
other way of remedying economic conditions except through the periodical
dropping of a paper ballot through a slit.
</p>

<p>
<em>Life’s Lure</em>, by John G. Niehardt. [Mitchell Kennerley, New York.]
A novel of Western mining life which has the same note of virile realism as
has the very worthy verse of the same author. A healthy contrast to the
usual Western compound of Deadwood Dick and puling sentimentality. One
of the best pieces of red-blooded stuff that has recently been written. Jack
London had better look to his laurels.
</p>

<p>
<em>Change</em>, by J. O. Francis. [Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, New York.]
A play to be read. Life here without affection states itself in its own terms.
The timid and the frivolous may read this and have their eyes opened.
Labor’s struggle for freedom is forcefully depicted. The scene is laid in a
little Welsh mining town, and the characters are drawn with simple charm
and beauty. A play that breaths life and truth.

<p>
<em>Everybody’s Birthright</em>, by Clara E. Laughlin. [Fleming H. Revell Company,
New York.] Miss Laughlin has both sympathy and understanding
for the ideals of young girls. In this little book she makes clever use of
the Jeanne d’Arc story as a means toward helping another Jean to bear the
loss of a twin sister.
</p>

<p>
<em>Myths and Legends of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes</em>, by
Katharine B. Judson. [A. C. McClurg &amp; Co., Chicago.] Here are some old
friends: Hiawatha, Nokomis, and Minnehaha—also Bre’r Rabbit and the
Tar Baby; and some myths of fire, wild rice, and Mondamin the Corn
Woman, which furnish a fascinating comparison with Prometheus and
Demeter over in the Aegean. A careful arrangement of material overcomes
in part the misfortune of fragmentariness.

<p>
<a id="page-69" class="pagenum" title="69"></a>
<em>The Twenty-Fourth of June</em>, by Grace S. Richmond. [Doubleday,
Page &amp; Co., New York.] A study of love at first sight—or just before.
Rich Kendrick came into the house by the back door and saw a rose-colored
scarf on the hatrack; but the poor young millionaire had to wait weeks before
meeting its owner, and then months until <em>Midsummer’s Day</em> for his
answer. Incidentally he discovered the charms of work, home and good
women.
</p>

<p>
<em>Tansy</em>, by Tickner Edwardes. [E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York.] A
charming story of the Sussex downs, by a man who lives among them. The
background of village characters, of rural incidents, and of the Sussex
countryside is exquisitely done. Tansy Firle is not a Watteau shepherdess—quite
the contrary; she has a compelling personality and a beauty of the
sturdy upland variety.

<em>La Vie des Lettres</em>: Collection anthologique et critique de poèmes et

The July issue of this important quarterly is both breezy and instructive.
Two exotic poems by the Roumanian, Alexander Macedonski; a cycle
of poems by Nicolas Beaudrien (who was introduced to English readers by
Richard Aldington in the June <em>Egotist</em>); a few dainty-grotesque <em>Images de
la Capitale</em>, by Carlos Larronde,—they form what I called the breezy part.
Of great charm also are the “ponderous” features. Among others there is
an article by William Berteval on <em>Tolstoi et L’Art pour L’Art</em>; an attempt of
a modernist to justify the Russian’s point of view on art. In its international
review the Quarterly mentions <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, with a “memento” for
the poems of Nicolas Vachel Lindsay and Arthur Davison Ficke.

Permit me to voice a different opinion from that expressed by Charles Ashleigh
in his review of Galsworthy’s <em>The Mob</em>. It is my contention that Mr. Galsworthy
has sympathetically and powerfully portrayed the uncompromising idealist, the champion
of an unpopular idea in this virile disrobing of the spangled strumpet Patriotism.
</p>

<p>
In these stirring times of destruction to appease insatiable kaisers, czars, kings
and the uncrowned masters of despotism <em>The Mob</em> comes as an opportune declaration
of the minority against war, against invasion, and against “Love of country.”
</p>

<p>
Stephen More, the type of man whose conscience and sense of justice cannot
realize that “idealism can be out of place,” makes a brave, aggressive stand against
the allied forces of position, friends, love, and the blind hatred of the despicable mob,
armed only with an unprejudiced, faithful ideal. Such passion and sincerity of purpose
<a id="page-71" class="pagenum" title="71"></a>
surely should presage victory. The real victory is won at the moment when
More dies for his idea at the hands of the very mob that many years later erects a

begins again: inflammatory patriotism, destruction, and a chaotic, purposeless Hell on
earth.

This is the psychological moment for the

United States. When nearly every world
power except the United States is at war, the
history of our relations with a country, one of
whose dominions borders ours for a distance
of 3,000 miles, cannot help being intensely interesting
and helpful to an

In this volume Mr. Powell treats of those
portions of the West which have not been
hackneyed by tourists and railway companies
in the same vivid, entertaining, and acute
manner in which he treated Africa in “The
Last Frontier.” The volume is, incidentally,
a narrative of the most remarkable journey
ever made by automobile on this continent—a
narrative upon which are strung descriptions
of the climate, customs, characteristics,
resources, problems, and prospects of every
state and province between Texas and Alaska
in such a manner as to form the only comprehensive
and recent volume on the Far
West. The narrative is
brightened by what is probably
the most striking collection
of pictures of American
frontier life that have
ever been gathered together.

“First, last and all inclusive in Miss Amy Lowell’s poetic equipment is vitality
enough to float the work of half a score of minor poets.... Against the multitudinous
array of daily verse our times produce ... this volume utters itself
with a range and brilliancy wholly remarkable.... A wealth of subtleties and
sympathies, gorgeously wrought, full of macabre effects (as many of the poems
are) and brilliantly worked out ... personally I cannot see that Miss Lowell’s
use of unrhymed vers libre has been surpassed in English. This breadth and ardor
run through the whole fabric of the subject matter.... Here is the fairly
Dionysiac revelry of a tireless workman. With an honesty as whole as anything in
literature she hails any and all experience as stuff for poetry. The things of splendor
she has made she will hardly outdo in their kind.”

Paul Claudel was for many years in the French Government Service in
Cochin, China. “The East I Know” is a translation into English of his “La
Connaissance de l’Est.” It is a series of word pictures of life in the Far East
written by a poet whose individuality and originality are bound to make a profound
impression on American as they have already done on Continental
readers. The translators have captured with complete success the author’s
exquisitely delicate feeling for words which give the color and soul of the East
with poetic modulation yet unmistakable truthfulness.

This is the first of M. Claudel’s work to appear in English and is expressly
authorized by him.

<p>
The second group of Hauptmann’s Symbolic and Legendary
Dramas gains unity by a recognizable oneness of inspiration. The
poet has become a seeker; he questions the nature and quality of
various ultimate values; he abandons the field of the personal
and individual life and traces for us, through the poetic fabric,
the universal search for beauty, the problem of moral evil and
the transitoriness of earthly glory. [A special circular, with contents
of the preceding volumes, will be mailed upon request to the

A noteworthy manifestation of the interest in the stage and its
literature is the work, both in writing of plays and their performance,
of the gifted band organized as the Wisconsin Dramatic
Society. The three one-act plays in this volume are fruits of the
movement. Having met with success in the theatre, they are now
offered to the creative reader to whose imagination dramatic literature
is a stimulus.

<b>Playing With Love and The Prologue to Anatol</b>

<p class="r ada">
By ARTHUR SCHNITZLER
</p>

<p>
“Anatol” has been spoken of as the comedy of Light Love, but “Liebelei” is its
tragedy. If it is not Schnitzler’s ripest achievement, it is so far his finest play. Had
he written nothing else, his fame would be secure, for there is among modern plays
none with a deeper human note, none with less of false emotionalism. <em>12mo.</em>

Professor Chubb’s studies of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Swift, Pope,
Johnson, Burns, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth, Scott, Dickens, Thackeray,
George Eliot, Carlyle, Ruskin, Tennyson, and Browning, are marked by the understanding
that comes of deep interest and long study, by independence of judgment,
and vigorous expression. He has chosen his subjects to illustrate the eight great
movements in English Literature, and the plan of the work, as well as the manner in
which it has been carried out, will commend the volume to all students. The definite
purpose, comprehensive view, searching analysis, and attractive exposition of the
studies will impress all readers. <em>12mo.</em>

To All Men Goodyear Tire Supremacy
</p>

<p>
Light on the tire question leads men
inevitably to the Goodyear No-Rim-Cut
tire.
</p>

<p>
It has led hundreds of thousands to
them. Every month it leads many
thousands more. This has gone on until
Goodyears outsell any other tire that’s
built.
</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>
<b>Light</b>—which means information—shows
true quality
in Goodyears. It is
based on exclusive
features. We spend
fortunes on trouble-savers
found in no
other tire.
</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>
<b>Rim-cutting</b> is
ended by one of them—by
our exclusive No-Rim-Cut feature.
</p>

<p>
<b>Blow-outs</b> due to wrinkled fabric are
ended by our “On-Air” cure. That exclusive
process costs us $450,000 yearly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Loose tread</b> risk is reduced 60 per cent
by a patent method we alone employ.
</p>

<p>
<b>Punctures</b> and skidding are combated,
as in no other tire, by our tough, double-thick
All-Weather tread.
</p>

<p class="h3 adh">
For Comfort’s Sake
</p>

<p>
These things mean safety, sturdiness,
less cost per mile,
less trouble. They
combat the greatest
tire faults in the
best ways known.
</p>

<hr class="hr10" />

<p>
Remember them.
Some day—for comfort’s
sake if for
nothing else—you
are bound to adopt these tires.
</p>

<p>
Do it now. For winter tires, our All-Weather
tread is sufficient inducement.
Any dealer will supply you.

<p>
This is the first real history of what has actually happened since the great War
began. There have been books a-plenty dealing with the underlying causes and ambitions,
and with the Europe of July, 1914.
</p>

<p>
This book is not one of them; it deals specifically with the first phase of the War—from
the murder of the Austrian Archduke to the fall of Antwerp. It traces the course
of the different armies—English, German, French, Austrian, and Belgian—in language at
once simple, clear, and vigorous; shows you what moves they have made and why they
have made them; by what plan of campaign each hoped to achieve success and what the
measure of that success has been. There are numerous simple maps specially prepared to
make clearer the military operations.
</p>

<p>
Frank H. Simonds’ editorial comments on the War, as they have appeared in The New
York Evening Sun, have attracted nation-wide attention. No one has better succeeded
in showing people what the fighting is all about. Here is his book. The publisher hopes
to follow it later with other volumes dealing with succeeding phases of the War.

<span class="larger"><b>By WALTER LIPPMANN</b></span><br />
Author of “A Preface to Politics”
</p>

    </div>
  </div>
<p>
This is a book at once comprehensive, shrewd, vigorous, searching, and interesting—with
always a saving humor. In the course of sixteen chapters, Mr. Lippmann discusses
practically all the more important problems of our political, social, and economic life, and
the factors that have brought about that curious unrest everywhere so noticeable.
</p>

<p>
In one paper he shows that we are accustomed to methods in business that we would
not for a moment tolerate in politics. In another he submits Woodrow Wilson to an
analysis that seems to get under the man’s very skin. He analyzes proposed panaceas for
our ills (as well as the ills themselves) and show why they won’t work. In “A Note on
the Woman’s Movement” he explains with crystal clearness what it is all about.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Lippmann is a great deal more than a brilliant iconoclast—he deals not only
with the signs and cause of the present unrest, but with the order which is emerging
from it.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
